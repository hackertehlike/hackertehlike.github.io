            * welcome to my website * please stand by * this website is under construction * 
            i'm doing my best okay * no seriously * this isn't as easy as it looks *
            so i made this website so you can see what i've been up to * and obviously i've been up to a lot of things *
            why won't these boxes go where i want them to go * so anyway * as i've said i've been up to a lot of things *
            you can click on the icons to see what i've been up to * some of it anyway * for example, i've been learning
            how to make websites * but you don't need to click on an icon to see that because you're already on a
            website i've made * but also i've been up to some other things * mostly i've been up to some other things *
            like for example, not doing the school work i'm supposed to be doing * css goes brrr * actually the menu button
            doesn't work but that's because i don't know what to put there yet * it's a prank bro * did you know that no one
            knows what css stands for * css stands for <s>cool stuff</s> * css stands for cascading style sheets * thank
            you for being here * i hope you enjoy your stay *
