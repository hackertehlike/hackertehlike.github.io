Wojtek shivered as he pressed farther into the thick of the woods. Cold sweat licked down his back and the wind crawled along his arms, bloodshot eyes darting every which way as he walked. Walked. And walked.

His shallow breaths drummed in his ears, blinding one more of his senses after the canopy had woven itself closer together — he saw nothing of it now, as he could see nothing, nothing at all, but it would forever linger in Wojtek’s mind’s eye how the branches had, at once and without call, reached and twined around each other — this sinister orgy of thorns that cut off what little light filtered through the cloudy night. And the trees, oh the trees, how they had growled and snarled, hissed into his ear their perverse desires; desires of flesh and blood, and their sick yearning for his pain, how they craved the taste of his screams, his wails of agony.

But Wojtek could not hear the trees anymore.

He only walked.

And walked.

It was not the sort of walk Wojtek was accustomed to; for Wojtek always had used his legs to take him where he willed. And they had no choice but to oblige. They were a part of him after all, weren’t they; or so he had always thought — not that Wojtek, had, in fact, given thought to such a simple thing as walking before. But now, at this moment where his eyes and ears failed him, his legs had seized control; and they had but one clear goal.

And so they walked.

And walked.

Because if Wojtek did not walk, Wojtek would be ripped to pieces, devoured by the thing behind him, right behind, about to catch up, so much so that Wojtek felt its warm breath on his neck. And Wojtek’s legs seemed not too keen on the idea of what the thing — and such a terrible thing it was — wanted to do to him, to consume him, all crunchy bone and tender flesh, his plump, mouthwatering body, flavored by horror and delirium.

Wojtek picked up speed.

He winced as talons tore through his delicious skin, drawing warm, gory, greasy blood. It spilled down his back and washed over his rivers of salty sweat. A cold chill cut through his stomach, flaring desperately as it tried to claw its way up his chest. And what a success it was; for soon his entire torso was freezing inside out, his legs nevertheless persistent in flight. Wojtek had no choice but to listen to them.

The crunch of leaves broke through the barricade in his ears that cut out all sound but his breathing, dank earth and rot singing under his feet as he walked. Though he had not so far noticed it, his feet bled, marking his trail in a perfect record, a path of diamond glimmers left behind him upon the soil, a makeshift night sky against the nothingness of the real one above. Only two of his toenails were still rooted firmly in their nail beds — all the others he had already lost, buried somewhere in that twinkling trail, or was about to lose as they dangled on mere strips of raw tissue.

This was good news.

Not for Wojtek, of course; but the thing did not in fact care for nails; yes, nails were to be picked at for a second or two and promptly discarded, lest it blights the ripe meat wrapped around the skeleton, which was obviously a delicacy on its own, milky marrow sizzling, crisp, delectable.

Decay crept into the edges of his frayed mind. The weight of his steps echoed in the hollow darkness of the forest, melding with the low thrum of the trees. Metallic creaks rang as twigs scraped against each other, leaves gnashing at Wojtek, and helpless he was against the world, for Time itself dared not touch this place. Wojtek walked on, feeling the blood pool in his stomach, already curdled and heavy — what a treat to relish\! — and his lungs, seared by every intake of breath.

Then\! Aaaaah\! Blazing light, what bright glory\! It burned his eyes and ignited his head, a dazzling white sight\! Nothing\! Nothing in it but brilliance\! Nothing but absolute shimmering pain and torment and agony that clung to him like a second skin. And then he saw he was on the ground, screeching on all fours as the pain thawed out of him. Wojtek pushed himself to his feet.

He started to run.

The light had flared out and left him once again in the pitch black tar of the night, and he knew it was to stay forevermore; he felt it in his bones and his simmering gut, frothing with the shit that had liquified some million paces ago. The trees stepped out of his way, offhand, unconcerned, grinning as they watched the Fool hare around the cage.

Wojtek ran.

Fear, what a delicious seasoning — the flesh bursting with flavor as soon as you bite into it, what sating grease; and the eyeballs, that rubbery texture that teases the tooth in all the right ways, and then the sudden splash\! that breaks through the floodgate, orgasmic, electric, that squashy pulp of taste\!

Wojtek’s feet caught a claw reaching out to him. His screams, drowned as he felt the ground fall his way.

Wings fluttered against his body, slapping and lashing, dark feathers grazing his skin, beaks in his eyes, he screamed, he shrieked, he screeched, he writhed and thrashed and flailed his arms and legs against the violent tempest — a worm, a disgusting worm, all caked in sweat and blood and filth, his ribs cracked open, those visceral wails melting like butter and marinating that sweet pulp, and Wojtek fought, and Wojtek cried, and he prayed.

Grrrrrhhhhjjjjjjjrrrghhhhh.

Mmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmm\!\!\!
