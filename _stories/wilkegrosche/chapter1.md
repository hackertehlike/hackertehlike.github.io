Wilke Grosche wiped a bead of sweat from his brow, inhaling as he sought to flog air back into his lungs. In the wan light shed from the torch in his hand, he saw the hallway extend another twenty paces onward before melting away into the darkness. The stale air of the passage dizzied him, the stench of his own perspiration mixing with it. He could feel the wind calling to him across a reverie; but his senses told him that was all it was: a reverie, one long foregone.

Wilke glanced back over his shoulder. He had been wandering the deserted halls for the better part of an hour and it seemed to be getting him nowhere. Maybe he should just —

His eyes stung with the threat of welling tears. _No._ He would sooner starve to a slow, agonizing death here than to go back to that wretched place. So he ignored the pain in his blistered feet, and he carried on.

The earthen walls stretched on, ushering him forward. They betrayed nothing; and in their barrenness Wilke found nothing but his own fear. His eyes raked the tunnel for something. Anything. A spider. A centipede. Hell, even a lone worm would do. Yet whispered back to him were only the ghosts of his own breathing, the echoes of his own laboured steps.

And then, another twenty paces later, Wilke came to a halt.

He blinked.

A brass doorknob grinned a glimmering grin at him from a mere ten yards away, the light from his blazing torch dancing on the metal in wisps.

It had not been there a second ago.

He wended his way toward it, lingering awkwardly before the ingress. The wooden door was of plain fashion, not polished yet pristine. He swallowed to find his throat in dry knots, and knocked.

Nothing happened.

Then, with a click, the door swung back, blowing a breath of gleeful heat wafting the smell of roasted chestnuts and freshly brewed tea in Wilke’s face. Wilke swallowed again, shuddering at his core.

He glanced up the hall toward where darkness bore naught but the unknown, then down it where he had come from. Harrowing reminiscence flashed before his eyes; his scars, mementos of the witch, seared with the memory.

Even Wilke’s shadow trembled at the prospect of turning back, and right then the hallway felt impossibly cold; so Wilke cleared his throat and stepped in.

The room was appointed with furnishings of homely ilk. In the hearth spanning the wall to his right a gentle fire crackled, sputtering smoldering embers on the stone floor, most of which was covered by a thick carpet. A tapestry lined the opposite wall, depicting a flock of fauns at merriment. And at the center of the room waited a table set with a steaming samovar, complete with a silver bowl of sugar and frothed milk. His mouth watered at the scents as he eyed the high-backed chairs, his feet groaning.

He had barely twitched forward when a voice shot a surge of icy water down his spine. “Welcome, Friedrich.”

Wilke fought with all his might against himself to stay rooted, but he found himself pivoting on his heels nevertheless, pulled by an invisible force. His gaze alighted in spite of himself on the woman between him and the closed door.

A pair of storm-blue eyes stared at him from a moon-pale face, her lips curled into a smile that bore deep into him. He could do nothing but stand and stare at her otherworldly beauty, his lips slightly agape despite the dryness in his mouth. Her smile widened, and he swallowed, the warm light of his torch playing in her diamond eyes, entwined with the warm light of the fire in the grate.

The witch took a step toward him. She moved like rippling water, so gentle and so fluid yet with the ruinous power of a thousand sky-high waves hidden behind.

“How lovely to see your handsome face again,” she chimed as she stepped past, gesturing toward the chairs. “You look tired from your journey. Would you care for some tea?”

“No,” Wilke managed; a whiplash of horrors struck his mind in that moment — memories of the place he had come from, detail by excruciating detail forced into a fraction of a second.

But then the witch let out a gleeful chuckle, turning Wilke’s insides to ice. “It’s not going to poison you or anything.”

He nodded and stepped up to the table before she could make him; he was careful to avoid her touch as she took the torch from his hand. And as soon as she turned away to mount it on the wall, he felt the floodgates burst open.

He doubled over at once, his vision swimming as scorching tears tunneled their way out of his eye sockets. Shards of glass spun from mere air rived his abdomen, and his guts tumbled onto the floor, bouncing and writhing, his shrieks forced down as he retched up clots of blood.

Wilke looked up, shivering, at the beautiful witch, but the illusion had shattered. In her stead stood a gnarled hag, and such a vile hag she was, with her rotten teeth and disfigured form, long yellow nails filed to points, singed flesh where her eyes should have been.

Her booming shrill laughter echoed in the room.

The glint of a hoe’s silver blade edge caught his eye right before plummeted into his shoulder, and his ears popped at the sound of his screams that rent the air. Gore splattered and ran down his face, dribbling onto the carpet.

The hoe fell again, this time catching him on the stomach. The pain carved through his body and he squirmed, wails pouring out of him along with the tears.

“Stop!” he gasped, coughing up more blood. “Please… stop…”

“Oh my sweet Wilke,” the hag cooed. “Now the real nightmare begins.”

And then the hoe fell on him once more, sending him hurtling through darkness.

Wilke Grosche was yanked out of his sleep, sweat gathering in the valleys of his face.

The dim light of the moon trickled through the half-drawn shutters of his window, his dorm room now awash with electric blue, just like —

Wilke sat up in his bed, throwing off his blanket. The stagnant air of the summerly night brushed against his drenched skin, beads of sweat on his body gleaming crystal in the chalky illumination.

He rubbed his eyes, panting still, as though he could ward off the afterimages by doing so. His mouth had as good as turned to cotton.

Water.

The young man swung his legs down the edge of the bed, and frowned. “The fuck?”

Wilke had been a tall guy his entire life — but now the floor cowered away from his feet, it almost seemed, as his legs dangled midair. His eyebrows drew together. He pushed himself off the bed, stumbling as he landed; the world towered over him as he waddled over to the bathroom.

He’d only just passed the mirror when he stopped short.

His eyes strayed back to the spot they had only grazed in passing a second ago. Wilke almost fell over, losing his footing at the sight; he clambered up dizzily, gross disbelief sparking into life in his gaze as he inched closer to the mirror, steps shaking.

There, amid an exact replica of his room, stood a midget, all stocky and slimy, staring back at him with eyes that he had only seen in the mirror all these years.

“Oh my sweet Wilke,” the hag echoed in his mind. “Now the real nightmare begins.”
