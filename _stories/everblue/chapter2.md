Death burned bright in Aleksander’s mind.

Chilled water splashed against his face and trickled down his neck, tiny rivulets leaving dark paths of wetness on his shirt. Trying, impossibly, to wash out the tableau of death.

_Blood._

He fumbled for his towel, hands trembling as he felt the cloth soft on his skin. In the unlit gloom of his cabin, Aleksander’s eyes saw only the bright lines imprinted into his vision, every minute detail crisp and clear.

_Crimson blossoming on pale blue, winning an easy victory._

Leaning on the washbasin, he tried to focus on the cold surface smooth against his palms, a barricade of fine glass against the battering ram of macabre images.

_He stood at the center of a vast hall of marble and stone, before him a single seat of black and gold, and, at his feet, the woman bleeding to death. Behind him, a knot of gold-clad men stood in deathly-still attention, their composure fraying at the edges._

_“We thought it was_ her_, your Grace,” one said, winds of fear making his voice tremble like autumn leaves._

_His Grace, kneeling by the woman’s crumpled figure, looked up to meet Aleksander’s gaze with his own. In it was only destruction._

He had not intended to touch her — but, of course, he never did. In the sultry heat of Toll Marre, his hands had become slippery with sweat in his gloves, and in a moment’s lapse in judgment, he had slipped them into his pocket. He had grown careless. And now, he was paying the price.

_Blood spreading on the fine blue cloak, seeping into every thread and stitch._ It flashed over and over before his eyes, leaving no room for doubt. It was the very same cloak that the woman had slung over her shoulder, the lavish fabric at odds with the rest of her ensemble. He had thought it odd, then; not only that a dockworker could afford such a luxury, but also that she would wear it in such warm weather.

And then she had dropped it, hands quivering just as Aleksanders’ did now. If he had been thinking, he would not have picked it up. But he hadn’t been, and by the time he had seen her reach for the cloak in his hands, it had been too late. As her hand had brushed his, the avalanche of images had come crashing down, bringing Aleksander to his knees, sickness clawing its way up his throat.

Another glimpse of the future stolen by him; another ounce of his sanity stolen from him. He could feel them all now, his collected visions, though he saw in perfect clarity only the one. Sinking their teeth ever deeper, soaking through flesh and carving ruin into his bones. On his tongue, the biting taste of demise.

Aleksander made sure to slip his gloves back on before leaving his cabin.

Freya Valthorne stood before the window of her cabin, frowning at the docks beyond. Limned by the honeyed glow of the setting sun, the silky chiffon of her nightgown silhouetted her figure, fingers of light filtering through and pooling on the wooden floor. A new low for her certainly, being dressed in her nightly garb at this hour not because of an early night, but because she had not bothered to change out of it. Freya’s patience stood on its last legs, and she could already feel those legs quivering, ready to buckle in a snap.

She gritted her teeth, watching the freight queue trickle forth. The Toll Marren shore offered chaos and clamor; the bellowing of people and the rattling of wagons, bells pealing, horses whinnying, gulls crying in discontent carried into her cabin, riding the winds. The autumn-touched trees peeked out over the labyrinthine city, their crowns auburn and aureate. Among the milling crowd, capes spun in gold distinguished guards; their eyes sparkled and their smiles lingered as they chatted, careless and idle. Guards galore.

All of it, close enough to reach for, close enough to touch, yet somehow still a world away. Out in the open sea where there was naught but endless blue, each day a shadow of the one before, the _Everblue_ was an island, and Freya a castaway. Now, here, where all she yearned for was laid out right in front of her, it was a prison. Which was worse, she did not know.

_You know nothing of the world, Freya,_ the chorus echoed in her mind, mocking, jeering. Councilors, functionaries, noblemen. Her father’s voice, clear amid others, distinctly distrustful.

_Then show it to me,_ she had said. Time and time again, every reprise of the same discussion. _Let me go and see it for myself._

Perhaps then they would cease drowning all her suggestions in dubious disapproval — that had been the hope, at least. And when her father had at last crumbled and conceded, agreeing to send her to the summit, victory had run wild in her veins. Three(?) months ago she had stepped onto the _Everblue_, eyes on the horizon and heart ever beyond.

Now, as she eyed the stranger coasts of Ashazar, the foolishness of it all glared at her like the blazing sun above. She had not changed the world at the summit, and she certainly had not _seen_ it, stuck on the ship as she was. And soon the _Everblue_ would berth at the Hand, and as the mooring lines would loop about the bollards with quick hands, so would the gates of Freya’s prison swing shut on her forever. No more journeying. No more wonder. Evermore a life of being trifled away.

_This journey was supposed to change all of that,_ Freya thought, grinding her teeth. What a joke it had been, and she was the punchline.

Constance sat in the freight crate, wrapped in pitch darkness and hidden away from the world. The stale air inside filled her lungs, rancid with dust and dread. And as the last smoldering embers of adventure died out, bleakness descended upon her like a familiar veil. In the stillness only punctured by her own breathing, her limbs grew stiff, and her heart heavy with the burden of unbid farewells. Once more lost in time, Constance waited.

The loss of the watch smarted within, painfully palpable. Only last winter, Gus had given it to her as a Twelvetide present. When wound, it filled her mind with memories of him, of the crew, of times of delight and delinquency, laughter and blood. Like a bonfire kindled at midday, long before the first blue of nightfall painted the sky. A portentous parting gift, foretelling of this day.

And she had given it away, just like that, to a stranger. Everything, everyone she had left behind, abandoned twofold. She still had her memories, true; but they would succumb to the decay of time, moment by vanishing moment, crushed under its abundance as others had. The pain of it flourished within, expanding, penetrating. With the seeds of guilt sown in one’s soul, alone was a dreadful thing to be.

Nobody came to claim her. Though there were no shadows to shift in the absolute dark, no sliver of moonlight to pool at her feet, night arrived to swathe the world in black. Bit by bit she slid aside the lid covering the crate, the wan yellow illumination of the sconce lamps bright only by comparison. Still, her eyes narrowed as she emerged into the hold, surrounded by towers of freight without another soul in sight.

The hold stretched ahead for some fifty paces, the low ceiling and lack of portholes too reminiscent of a dungeon, the situation little helped by the dankness. The gentle sway of the ship, however, was a comforting sensation, a welcome reminder that there was no land beneath her feet. No guards around every corner, their gazes kept vigilant with the promise of a bounty enough for a comfortable retirement. No more running.

Constance’s boots made no sound as she padded over to the aft companionway. A glance showed nobody on the other end, and she crested the companionway with the lithe steps of practiced thieves, emerging into a narrow corridor leading further aft. Leading to the main cabin, by Constance’s guess, where the princess would be quartered. She headed in the opposite direction, embracing the shadows, listening to signs of danger approaching through the native symphony of the ship — the muted crashing of the waves against the hull, footfalls from above, the occasional wayward word as the crew moved about, nearly crossing paths with her. Weaving through the _Everblue_, she sidestepped milling sailors and servants with wariness and finesse, mapping out the ship in her mind, nook by nook, plank by plank.

_The order of business, then._ Three things to take care of before dawn: food, shelter, and a disguise. Her strategy of choice was to minimize contact; she would lay low until the next stopover, then become dust and smoke as soon as they berthed. True, it would make food and shelter a little trickier unlike a proper con, which rendered those aspects trivial. But it also created a host of other problems — façades to keep up, webs of lies to spin, boundless conversations to pull out of your arse.

_This is better,_ Constance told herself once more. _Safe. Simple._

_Lonely,_ her mind amended — she smothered it, the little voice drowning like a single spark under a mound of sand. _Don’t be seen. Lose your trail. Better this way, with all the dogs Calron will send after my scent._

As midnight lured the people of the ship into their own corners, the narrow passageways of the ship bowed before her, all hers to roam. The gleaming brass fixtures housing the lights twinkled in respect as she passed, making shadows stretch and shift as the ship rolled with the waves. The floorboards were silent in submission to her steps. Keeping clear of the weather deck and the vicinity of the main cabin, she prowled, a wraith unbidden. The smell of salt and sweet tar stuck to her, marking, anointing her.

She found the galley two levels above the hold. No light spilled into the narrow passageway. The closed door betrayed nothing. She turned the handle with a gentle hand, but a rattle was all it granted her. Feasible source of food, if only she could find a pick somewhere, or something to improvise one with. In the blacksmith’s forge, perhaps. But this was definitely promising. She would have to constrain her expeditions to the few hours during which the galley did not operate; with a ship this size, they likely had to —

Constance froze. The sound of a door being shut closed, followed by approaching steps, echoed through the halls. Too close. Too close by far. It came from the direction she had come, moments away from turning right into the corridor, the other end of the passage impossibly beyond reach. Glancing about, she saw no doors nearby, no niches to take cover in.

No second spared to think, Constance pulled herself up by the water pipes, arms and core flaring up in exertion. Tucking her feet underneath a ceiling joist right as she reached it, she pushed her mass up, distributing her weight evenly on the structure as she lay down. It may not have been the quietest approach, though an awfully precarious one. _It will have to do,_ Constance thought, heart hammering as she waited with bated breath. Hopefully, the illumination of the lamps did not reach high enough to banish the shadows affording her cover. And with luck, her maneuver had been smooth enough for its din to be lost within the ship’s regular commotion.

The man who entered the hallway was tall and lean of build, his pale hair bound in a topknot. Despite the hour, he had his uniform on, immaculate and crisp; he wore no jacket, though his shirt and trousers were starched and pressed. Curiously, he wore gloves on his hands, the black leather in stark juxtaposition to the white of his shirt.

Feeling exposed, Constance fought the urge to shuffle, but the man didn’t seem to have noticed her. He didn’t seem to have noticed much, at that. His intense gaze skimmed over the hallway with an emptiness behind it, clouded by a pall of deep thought. Muscles straining to keep her from losing her balance as the ship rocked, Constance watched him move nearer, his stride quick yet stiff. The angles of his face became clearer the closer he drew, the sharp cut of his jaw whetted even sharper with tension, brows furrowed in consternation. He was young — younger than she had initially thought, with a few years on twenty at most. As he reached the galley door, she held her breath, suspended in anticipation of his passing.

_Nearly there,_ she thought to herself, a glimmer of hope igniting within. _A few more steps and I will be out of sight._

Then the man halted.

Constance’s hands trembled around the length of timber she clung to, conquered by strain and dread. Her view of him was obstructed by the joist she lay on; but she could hear him still, his breaths hard and shallow. What then, if he had seen her? Should she jump down, or try to talk her way out of it? She hung on, mind racing as she felt the turning point of trouble inch closer.

The turning point came _crashing_ — the sound of splintering wood lashed the air, and Constance well-nigh lost purchase as the man’s gloved fist connected with the wall. He stepped back, reeling, his chest rising and falling as he stared at his handiwork. The silence-steeped hall offered no comfort, deathly still as though subdued by terror. The man glanced about the empty corridor, finding no witness; then, with wind-brisk steps, melted away from sight.

Constance blinked. Nothing down below whispered answers, though questions would find her soon if she did not disappear. She swung down, landing gently on the bare floor. Stepping into the shadows, she, too, vanished, leaving the brine-soaked corridor behind.
