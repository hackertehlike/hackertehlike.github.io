Constance stepped through the mansion's double doors, announcing herself to the household with a gleeful giggle. A breeze stole in after her through the open entrance, too gentle to explain the windblown state of her hair, too cool to explain the sweat glistening on her temples. Her fine leather boots left crumbs of dry mud on the Granhali carpet, but she paid it no heed, grinning from ear to ear as she entered the parlor.

The room was vast enough to hold several towering paintings, a feature shared by most rooms in the manor. This particular one was themed after a menagerie, with depictions of majestic beasts surrounding the large space. A proud tiger stood above the console, a giraffe in perpetual repose staring lazily out of a partition screen below. Woodland animals stood shoulder to shoulder with savannah creatures. And right across the room, the regal peacock gazed down at his subjects, the centerpiece.

“The weather is perfect today,” Constance said breathily. “You should finish preparations and take Speckles out before the sun sets — or take a little break now. I won’t tell.”

“I’m glad the Lady enjoyed her ride,” Abbington said with a brief glance at the trail of mud in her wake. “I myself must forgo it, unfortunately; there is much yet to take care of. And while I work on the necessary arrangements for the evening, I will have a bath drawn up for the lady.”

If Constance gave the majordomo a knit-browed side-eye, she did not voice her objections. It had been a few years since he had stopped asking her questions the answer to which he knew would not be in his favor. At least he had not called her “Little Lady” since her tenth birthday. She was eleven now, wild in the way that only eleven-year-olds could afford to be. Not a measly ten anymore; but eleven — one and one. Two digits and no zeros. She was practically a grownup, the charcoal lines on her room’s doorframe almost as tall as Speckles. And so what if she smelled of damp earth and horse — it was not as if any of the guests would be able to smell her through the thick cloud of pungent perfume mixed with champagne breath.

“You wouldn’t happen to know if Boy is coming tonight, would you?” Constance asked, shrugging off her riding jacket.

“The Grand Dame Valaeron has not made any explicit requests in advance,” Abbington said. He cracked a small smile. “Though it is entirely possible. We often prepare treats just in case.”

Constance’s grin widened, anticipation bubbling inside her. For some reason, adults expected her to be present during these stupid gatherings; and worse, they expected her to _seem_ attentive, even though no one was under the illusion that the eleven-year-old would care to engage with the dreariest thing known to mankind — small talk at dinner parties. Adults put themselves through the strangest things at times for no apparent reason.

Perhaps Constance was not _entirely_ grownup just yet. And she was not _entirely_ upset about the fact, either.

Oddly enough, while it was disrespectful to occupy oneself instead of keeping up the charade of listening, adults did not mind it so much when children played with pets at parties. And so the Grand Dame’s handsome foxhound, Boy, had become Constance’s best friend on such eves.

Footfalls echoed off the stone floor of the corridor, heralding her father’s arrival. Constance turned just in time to see him enter the parlor, sharp as always in his immaculate robes. The family crest glimmered proudly on his chest, but his features lacked the spirit, replaced by a grimness that bled into the room.

“Ah, you’re here. Good. I’ve been looking for you,” he said to Constance. “Come, dearest. There is… something of great import.”

“Abbington was about to prepare a bath for me,” Constance said. In the gray light of the bleak breath in his words, the bath suddenly did not seem so unappealing.

“It will have to wait.”

Abbington lowered his head slightly to peer at his master over his glasses. “My Lord?”

“Cancel the dinner, Abbington. We must be off. The Grand Dame already knows; notify all other guests.” He turned to Constance. “You’ll want to change into warm clothes, dearest,” his father said. “We’ll be traveling through the night.”

“Where are we going?”

“We will have more time in the carriage for questions. Get ready.”

Constance glanced sideways at the majordomo as she passed by him though he did not meet her gaze, his questions buried beneath his sense of duty. Yet, she could see in the stark lines of his face the selfsame worry that prickled her stomach. Very little in the world stood unbent before her father’s command. Mountains. The heavens. Constance.

And to the best of her knowledge, she had done nothing of late to warrant this. Whatever had put him in this mood was a thing Constance did not want to know about.

Still, she shuffled to her bedroom upstairs to slip into warmer clothes as her father had said, and stuffed a satchel with a cardigan and a slingshot.

By the time she returned downstairs, the white-streaked blue of the sky had bled into a deep purple, the courtyard already swathed in dark shadows. The carriage’s single oil lamp swayed on its hook, illuminating little more than their driver’s leathery face.

Anslo Warf was a man of middling years with the face of an elder. He spoke with the patchy inflection of Ascoti fishermen, though he had never even set foot near the town. He had fled his home country on an unsanctioned ship that had had the good fortune to be plundered and sunk; an Ascoti fishing boat had found him clinging to some flotsam for dear life. The father and son who had reeled him in had taught him the tongue and brought him to these shores, where Anslo had had the good fortune to come under his father’s employ.

Now, he sat already in wait, the reins to the skittish Moonbeam and Rapidfire ready in his hand. His father helped her into the tight box of the carriage. The shadows reigning outside had burrowed into the carriage as well, crowding the already suffocating space. Constance settled into the bench facing forward, blinded by the gathering darkness; she heard rather than saw her father climb in to sit across. Then, with the warning tinkle of tiny bells, cold light suffused the car, damping the pressing shadows. Her father deposited the fairy light into the small housing on the wall opposite the door, and gave the signal to Anslo Warf.

A crack of the whip, and they were off, bobbing through paved streets through the heart of the city.

“Where are we going?” Constance said into the silence disturbed only by the rattle of the carriage and the clip-clop of Moonbeam and Rapidfire.

“To the north,” her father said. “To Culcheth, beyond the border.”

“Why are we going there?”

“There is something I must show you.”

“What kind of thing?”

He was silent for a spell. When he answered, he did not meet her eyes. “You’ll see.”

“Why didn’t Mama come?”

“She is busy.”

Constance sat there, unsure what to do, her chest tight with apprehension. For once, her father’s reluctance to answer did not ignite her curiosity. She kept herself busy with the task of cleaning the mud accrued under her nails from the day’s adventure until they left the city, their exit marked by the bumpy turn of the road though there was no window to see by. Still, the exhaustion of the day descended on her, and despite the battle of the carriage against the rough, dirt-packed thoroughfares cutting through the northern countryside, she soon dropped into a slumber.

She woke up as the carriage clattered to a halt, stiff-limbed and dazed. For a moment she lay in the dark, wondering at the hard surface that dug into her back and the too-firm pillow beneath her head. Then the recollection of the evening washed over her, and the pillow stirred, her father’s familiar warmth revealing it to be his leg. She groaned, throwing her arm over her eyes as the carriage door cracked open, a slice of light seeping into the compartment.

“The wheels will be no welcome here on out, they won’t, boss,” Anslo said. “You say I drive forth, I drive forth, I do; but sooner I drive straight off a cliff so we be off quicker, I say. It’s nary a twenty-minute walk down the path, anyway. ”

“Stay here and watch the carriage, then.” He brushed back a strand of her hair, away from her face. “Dear, we have to walk from this point on.”

“Where are we going?”

“You will see.”

She clambered down onto the earthen ground with legs half-asleep, and drank the crisp country air. Honeyed dawn skies bathed the world in a syrupy glow, feathered clouds in ruby red, orchid purple, and cherry blossom pink drifting eastward. Lush hills fell away before her, blanketed in rich emerald and speckled by a thousand hues that perfumed the wind with a thousand scents — honeysuckle, lily, and jasmine; morning dew on fresh grass, and wild rosemary. A mountain brook shone silver as it flowed, as though myriad wishing coins covered the bed, working their magic.

Constance closed her eyes, listening, communing, harkening to the rustling whisper of the northern hills.

Something was off.

She looked back up, her eyes seeking birds — and indeed, she found them circling above, their feathers glossy with a purplish iridescence. _Rooks_. And only then did she notice the hollow quiet of the place, and the wayward ash eddying in the wind, nearly unnoticeable.

She turned, stepping up to stand beside her father, who stood with his back to her, gazing out over the other side of the hill.

Culcheth was a small village tucked away into the valley, made up of barely more than a score of houses, a few workshops, and some patches of land. At first glance, it seemed awash in the pomegranate tint of the daybreak skies, a slumbering village right before the first hours of another busy day, like air pregnant with frost right before the year’s first snowfall.

Smoke was no unusual sight for a village landscape. Not by half, certainly. And indeed, here too did smoke curl skyward — in all the wrong places. The forge’s chimney did not ripple with plumes, but a column of gray smoke rose from the heap of rubble closest to them — one of many, if the only one afire.

The wind that jostled Constance’s hair and smelled of spring blossoms now whispered of something else. Blood, ash, and ruin. Hung linens billowed in the breeze on clotheslines, dirtied with splashes of red and brown.

Constance felt herself suck in a sharp breath. “What happened here?”

His father’s voice was tender, in the way that a father lays his wasted child into the grave. “That’s what we are here to see.”

Looking up, the clouds no longer spoke of rubies and flowers, but of blood and flesh. Looking down, Constance could see why Anslo had suggested they stop where they had. The treacherous path snaked down the hill with no mind for wideness or safety.

“Come.”

At that moment, Constance found that eleven was not too grownup an age not to reach for her father’s hand. As they set off wending their way down, she clutched her bag tight, hands itching to reach for the slingshot. She was glad for the warm clothes and the comfortable boots, not minding the ash that clung to them. Watching always for the next step, and only that, she managed to make it down to the mouth of the crooked path that led to the village square, never letting her gaze stray to the scene below. Too soon it was below no longer, but right up ahead — and despite her deepest desire to turn and scramble back up the rocky path, she stood her ground and forced herself to face it.

She had thought she would discover a thousand new details down here, but it was the same horrible diorama she was looking at — only, tenfold _more_, with an _allness_ to it that had been lacking when the village was only part of the landscape.

Her mind felt distant, as though the lines and edges of the world didn’t quite fit one another. Somehow, the air sizzled with stifling heat and crackled with a cutting chill all at once. Shadows seemed to lap at them like ravenous beasts as they walked the path, and Constance noticed that a web of cracks spanned the ground, as though the earth itself had shattered.

“What happened here?” she asked again, finding her voice more muted than before. Or perhaps it was the pressing, too-material quiet stuffing her ears.

“Sytani raiding party. They crossed the border last night. Headed west to Limun. This was along the way.” There was a matter-of-factness to the way his father’s words rang. “Looks like they got everyone inside…” He trailed off as he stopped short, a heap of rust-red clothes at his feet. Perhaps the owners had intended to hang them up on the clothesline, the soiled linen billowing in the breeze five feet from —

Even the scream beginning to claw its way up Constance’s throat froze.

Only then did it occur to her that she had never seen a dead body in her life. Not till now.

His father did not bother to check for signs of life. It would have been futile anyway.

“Let’s walk on.”

Steered by her father’s gentle hand on her shoulder, Constance’s feet managed to move her forth; her mind remained rooted, reeling still.

“Who did this, Constance?”

The sound of her name on his father’s lips in lieu of ‘_dearest_’ was sobering. “Sytani raiding party.”

“Men, Constance,” her father said. “Men did this.”

He paused, something on the tip of his tongue that his lips did not let escape; then he turned toward the nearest standing building, and despite her best instincts, Constance followed.

The discordant note of the door creaking on its hinges ground against the whimpering wind. There was no flooring, only damp earth. The sole room of the house was dark and austere. There was little in the way of light inside, the lamp on the shabby wooden table unlit. Perhaps it had been put out before bed. Perhaps it had died with its owners.

Blood puddled in the hearth, leaving it damper than the rest of the room. And, at the foot of the bed, lay the source. Flies buzzed about the corpses, disturbing the dead.

Constance closed her eyes, cursing her memory for the first time in her life. The afterimages shone bright and starkly vivid against her lids.

There had been no mercy, no purpose other than violence. This could not have been men. For the first time in years, Constance thought of the monsters in old wife’s tales who ate men’s souls and wore their skin.

They stepped foot into no other house ripe with the remembrances of the night’s tragedy. They spoke no words as they climbed the hill to a morning that had already forgotten. Only once Culcheth lay miles and miles behind them, and they were back in the familiar safety of the manor house, did their silence break.

“Constance,” her father said, kneeling to meet her daughter’s eyes and enveloping her hands with his. “I am so sorry.”

Constance could only nod.

“I am so sorry,” he repeated, his voice a near-whisper. “I wish I did not have to show you this. I wish I could take you there only to show you the flowers, to play with you in the running brook. To race you, you astride Rapidfire and me Moonbeam, the wind in our hair. But there are things you and I must understand. Things _we_ must brave so that _they_ never have to again. So we may carry the pain in our hearts, imprison it, shelter from it the rest of the world. Such is our power. Such is our duty.”

That night, Constance learned that eleven was small enough an age to sleep in your parents’ bed. And that grownups, even fathers, could weep.
