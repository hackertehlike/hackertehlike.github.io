All around Constance, the fire raged.

A world of gold and crimson, of fury and smoke. The heat of it suffocating, its hunger absolute.

Constance did not know where it had come from. One moment she and her crew had been basking in the bliss of the game, the seconds ticking eagerly toward the moment of victory as they worked on the safe’s lock. The next, utter chaos ruled with a fist of fire.

Acrid fumes stung her lungs, her skin buried under a thick coat of sticky sweat, ears deafened by the roaring inferno. Scattered about the room, her crewmates were obscured from sight by blazing walls of destruction. On the opposite end of the room, the sole set of stairs leading down suffered a similar fate, shrouded by the spreading flames – a fact corroborated by the wood’s snapping cries of agony as the fire devoured the steps like a great, ravished beast.

_Fuck._ Constance closed her eyes, a cough penetrating her sigh. _No way out._

“Kress?” She spluttered through the pungent smog. “Leira? Bunny?”

If her crewmates had heard her, their responses were entirely subdued by the popping and cracking incandescence. She eyed the burning barricade, the untamed beast closing in with a savage voracity, its scalding breath sharp in her throat. Constance whirled, hunting for something, anything – a _way out_.

The safe containing the would-be loot – useless as far as her escape was concerned. The chair beside it, tendrils of fire creeping up its legs. And behind her, the fixed window overlooking the narrow street spread beneath, a meandering serpent weaving through the cramped tangle of buildings.

Her gaze alighted on the view down below, a crowd gathering to gape at the fire – and, dotting the horde, glimmers of gold coruscating richly in the glare of the flames.

_Fuck._ Constance ducked, hugging the wall as she peeked out. The prince’s men, no doubt about that – though likely there because of the fire, and not her. _Yet._ If she had any chance of keeping it that way, she would have to run, and she would have to run fast.

She glanced back at the nearing flames, her friends lost to sight beyond. Reversing it so the black side was showing, she slung her discarded cloak over her shoulder. Then, she swung the chair at the glass.

It shattered, raining on the flurried crowd as the chair plummeted, smashing into pieces and sending up a gust of splinters, the cobblestones awake with flames. Constance leaped.

Her legs screamed upon impact, but there was no time to stop and suffer. She broke out into a sprint, away from the crowd and the gold-caped men, her feet dragging her where instinct pulled. East, zigzagging through the shabby market stalls and throngs of confused shoppers, the jagged pavement treacherous. Her pulse boomed in her ears, but they didn’t block out the pursuing steps and shouts.

Warm blood trickled down Constance’s brow, clouding her vision. She wiped it away with a sweaty hand as she took a left turn, gore sticking on her right temple. Her chest rattled, the run hardly mild on her soot-punched lungs.

'Hey, stop!' A glint of gold crept into the corner of her vision.

_Keep going. Not far now._

A splintering wheelbarrow lurched into her path. Constance dodged it narrowly, but the rim rammed into her side, an aching throb burgeoning to life. A small smile graced her lips as the din of smashed wood mingled with shouts pierced through her thudding pulse.

The labyrinthine alleys of Toll Marre twisted and turned, an unsparing warren in the most orderly of the city’s districts. Here in its underbelly, however, the maze was a deadly snare ready to snap shut, a decayed maw of smoke and shadows incongruous with the gold capes of the prince’s guards. Constance wove through the maze, its secrets long untangled in her years of crime and debauchery, her legs and feet ablaze with pain from the fall and the chase, her face warm with blood and sweat.

At last, the dilapidated remains of a once-pleasant façade rose four stories before her, the boarded windows and moldy walls more welcoming than ever. She crossed the junk-strewn alley to the rear entrance, too out of breath to care about the stench of piss, and with no shortage of urgency, rapped on the door.

Four sets of double knocks. _Help._

Heavy footfalls beat the ground nearby.

_Come on, Priscilla._

Then, with a creaking of hinges, the door cracked open. Constance threw herself into Priscilla’s backroom, slamming the door shut behind her.

Inside, greasy light was spread thin in the dark room where boarded windows kept out all dangers of sunlight and its comforts along with it. Piled against the walls were linen-covered crates, decrepit and greyed from the grime and mildew, the carpet of dust coating the floor disturbed by footprints. And by the door, Priscilla, the dim light of her lamp flickering in the whites of her large eyes, casting shadows that pooled in the dark-skinned woman’s hollow cheeks. Leaning against the wall to steady herself, Constance met her gaze.

“Inside,” Priscilla said, taking her by the arm. “Now.”

The woman guided Constance through the corridor and up the stairs, setting down the lamp to unlock one of the guest rooms. Inside, the furnishings were sparse – a bed and a small chest, a tub tucked into the corner of the room, and a sconce lamp emanating barely enough light to see by. But the bed alone made the room feel palatial as Constance sunk into it, weighed down by bone-weary exhaustion.

“You need a bath. I’ll be right back,” Priscilla said, and turned to leave. Then, stopping short at the door, she darted a look back at Constance. “Kress and the others?”

Constance shook her head.

The water had turned brown by the time Constance got out of the bath, blood and soot bleeding into it in swirls of scarlet and black until the two tones blended into an ugly umber. She dried herself and slipped into the shirt and breeches Priscilla had left for her, her side still tender where a bruise was starting to take form.

Downstairs, she found Priscilla alone in the common hall, a bowl of steaming soup waiting for her. There was some light streaming in through the windows here, though wax paper hid the outside world from the inside, and, more importantly, the inside from out. The hearth was unlit with the day sultry enough as it was, the walls still soot-streaked from nights past telling tales by the fire though the words themselves had vanished.

“They haven’t come,” Priscilla said, reading the question in Constance’s eyes as she sat down. “What happened?”

“Fire,” said Constance. “We were upstairs, about to break the safe open, when we noticed the smoke.”

“Shit.”

“Yeah. It practically climbed up the stairs, so we were trapped on the second floor. And a burning building in the middle of Eyrie isn’t exactly inconspicuous, so there was a crowd. And… well. Some gold-capes, too.”

“Shit.”

“Yeah. But I doubt they realized I’m the one they have been hunting all over the city for days. I jumped out the window and booked it before they could take a good look.”

“And the others?”

“They were… out of sight. We were separated by the flames and I…”

“I’m sure they are all right,” Priscilla cut in, the chair opposite Constance squeaking against the floor as she pulled it aside. “Though it was hardly the brightest idea you lot have had, to begin with. _Really._ What in the hells were you thinking? Even without the fire, it could not have been worth it, especially split among the five of you.”

And she was right, after a fashion. Whatever the safe contained, Constance doubted it could justify breaking into the place in broad daylight with the Calron Solgaard’s men at Constance’s heel, their numbers increasing daily as the prince’s patience diminished to its last dregs. Indeed, when Kress had first pitched the idea, attempting to entice her with _one last chance for loot,_ Constance had raised the same points herself.

After all, money was easy to come by – a sly hand, a loaded die, a rigged deck of cards; and you got yourself a full belly, a new jacket, and a new bed to wake up on that you didn’t quite remember going back to the night before.

But then Kress had risen from his chair, stood on it, and raised his glass of top-shelf brandy in the air as he spoke, looking entirely too out of place in his tailored waistcoat and trousers. “_For a last hurrah, then. An ode to you, dear Constance. An ode to_ us_.”_

And of course, it had been difficult to argue with that.

“You’re right,” Constance said. “But that’s why we did it. It was meant to be _a fitting finale_, as Kress put it. _A final bow.”_

Priscilla paused, brows drawing closer together, adding more lines to her weathered face. “I’m not sure I’m following.”

“Priscilla…” Constance paused to put her spoon down, straightening in her chair, and stared at the innkeeper, voice growing bleak. “I’m leaving tonight.”

Dreary silence descended. In the heavy quiet that hung over them, even the dust swirling in the air seeming to sink into the worn floorboards under its burden, Priscilla’s gaze softened as she regarded the girl. “And you are sure of it? If you stay —”

“He’ll have me executed.”

“Perhaps not,” the innkeeper said. “Not if you —“

“No,” Constance cut in. “I’ve made my choice, and it is final. I’m leaving Toll Marre. Tonight.”

With a deep sigh, Priscilla donned the pained smile once more, seating herself in the chair across Constance’s with a nod.

“You’ve made up your mind, then.”

“I have. I can’t run from Calron’s men forever. Not if I’m here, right under his nose. And I don’t like either of the other choices.“

“Do you have a plan?”

A smile tugged at the edges of Constance’s lips. “Something like that.”

“Well, then. I suppose I’ll have to nurse Kress and Leira back to good humor all by myself when they come waddling in in a few hours.” Priscilla winked. “For now, rest.”

Night fell in a crescendo of noise and color. As one crowd stepped into the comfort of their abodes, shrugging off the day’s fatigue along with their work clothes, another stepped out, replacing the smell of earth and sweat in the wind with liquor and seaspray. Outside Priscilla’s inn, Eyrie Street bloomed with life as the nightly crowd filtered in through the cracks of the thoroughfare, lifeblood pumping new vigor into the vein. And the street received with open arms the returning kings and queens of low life, the cream of the wickedest crop.

The dance of the two crowds did not seep in through the walls of the inn. Only the light filtering through the papered-over window changed, first dimming from the warm illumination of the bright afternoon sun to twilight gloom, then slipping into patchy brightness as lanterns and streetlamps twinkled awake on the Eyrie. The two women sat in anticipatory wait, whispering over steaming tea once the innkeeper had cleaned and stitched up Constance’s cut brow, jumping at every street cry or slammed door though no one came knocking at the backdoor. No Kress, no Leira, no Bunny nor Sir John Ross. And with every passing hour, Constance’s calm demeanor frayed at the edges a little more, her absent gaze lingering longer on nothing, her smiles carrying a little less warmth.

When at last she flicked open her pocket watch glimmering softly in the dark blue radiance of dusk, Priscilla merely smiled, pulled her into a matronly embrace, and removed the reversible cloak off its peg, easing it onto Constance’s shoulders black-side-out.

“Thank you,” Constance said, glad for the absence of light as her eyes stung, threatening tears. Her lips parted, though reaching for words, she found none to hold onto.

“Stop by Gus on the way,” said Priscilla. “And don’t worry about the others. After all these years, it won’t be a damned fire that does them in.”

Constance smiled. “You saw that in your crystal ball, did you?”

Priscilla winked, the oily light glinting off her grin, and the lock rattled as she turned the doorknob.

With that, Constance disappeared into the dark of the coming night.

The sign in front of Gus’s shop swung softly in the wind, lamplight shifting on the carved brass. Her cloak rippling in the same wind, Constance stood before the door, unusual in her stillness as all around her the city exchanged crowds, moving about her like a river around an islet.

The seconds ticked away in her mind, sand trembling down into the lower bulb of the hourglass. Her way out of the city was not going to wait in the harbor forever, and it certainly would not be waiting for her since it was oblivious to her coming. And then there were the prince’s men, capes of gold sprinkled throughout the city and greater in number each passing day – an extra pair of guards at each post, a second post around each corner – looking for _her_. Calron’s latest gift. _Men are meant to shower women with attention,_ her mother’s voice cooed in her head, and Constance’s lips curled up in a smirk despite herself.

She stood there, staring at the door as though she could see the man at his quiet old bench, slouching over a slice of metal as she was certain to find him if she were to walk in at that very moment. She was only slightly less certain that it would make her want _not_ to leave.

But goodbye was inevitable, whether or not she stayed here in Toll Marre, and Constance knew that.

_I might not make it on time if I go in,_ she thought, though she failed to convince herself, all too aware of her futile attempt at justification. There was no bluffing when you played against yourself.

_I might come back,_ she thought then. _I have all the time in the world for that._

But Gus didn’t. The elderly man’s heart was already beginning to give, and chances were he would not be here to see it if she ever did decide to return.

Then, bells tolled to announce the top of the hour, flocks of birds taking wing in a chorus of caws and flutters. One last time Constance looked at the door; then, she walked away.

Down the street and toward the docks, she strode, where the setting tangerine sun coated the sea in a gauze of white glimmers. Sentries stationed at the docks idled about, strolling unalert in the golden light, their skin tanned, enameled weapons glinting in their sheaths. Anchored by the harbor stood a giant ship, her sails as blue as patches of the sky above, her hull dark and polished. The two-headed phoenix atop the main mast billowed proudly in the wind, golden embroidery afire in the last sunglow. The _Everblue_.

Tucking herself in the cover of the wall surrounding Lord Westerliss’s estate, Constance surveyed the scene. Only docked for replenishments, the _Everblue_ had no new passengers boarding, but a plethora of chests and boxes and crates and barrels being wheeled up a ramp into the hold. The queue of carts snaked into the parallel street, men and women waiting with whistling impatience to deliver their wares. Even from a distance, Constance could pick out the two men overseeing the cargo, their immaculate suits out of place among the grime and disarray of the docks.

With the abundance of sentries, discovery meant doom. But Constance kept to the shadows, and the shadows were hers. In the bejeweled blue of twilight, there was no better veil to don for one wishing to vanish. Past wooden doors lost under lichen, past wearied workers wending their way home, she followed the queue. Her boots beat the wet cobblestones, shimmering and slippery, as she searched.

She found what she was looking for near the tail end.

“Hello,” Constance said. “You look like you might need a new coat.”

The woman reeled, startlement plain on her face. “Pardon?”

“Your coat. It’s threadbare. I know it is rather warm now, but you will have to replace it when the weather turns.” Silence hung between them as Constance paused, waiting. The only reply came from the cawing gulls. “I could offer you mine.”

The woman cocked a distrustful brow at Constance, but her eyes betrayed her as they stole a perusing glance at the thick fabric snug around Constance’s shoulders. Constance smiled.

“It is reversible, too. Here, I’ll show you.” She shrugged off the cloak, the heavy material _whumping_ as it fell in a cascade of rich blue. “See?”

“What do you want?”

“Ah, so you do like it. Good. Then our interests complement each other,” Constance said, voice dripping with honey. “I only need a small favor, it won’t take much of your time.”

With narrowed eyes, she regarded Constance, who rapped her knuckles on the rough wood of the large crate between them.

“What’s in these?”

“Linen. Why?”

“Linen? I can work with linen,” Constance said. “You see, I would appreciate it _greatly_ if I could, say, curl up inside this for a little bit.“

“That’s not going to work, I’m afraid. This crate is going on the big ship.”

“And I’m okay with that,” Constance said with a smile.

“I’m not. So piss off.”

“The cloak is not enough? Fine, we’ll have it your way.” A flash of gold twinkled in Constance’s hand before the woman could blink, a pocket watch dangling on its dainty chain pulled out of thin air. “Enough to change your mind?”

The merchant woman stared at her silently for a spell.

“You are wondering what I’m playing at, aren’t you?” Constance continued. “Don’t. There is no need for you to worry. This has little to do with you – beyond the bit where your pocket grows heavier, of course.”

“The buyer has already filled it. Seems to me it’s more trouble than it’s worth.”

“Ah, but there is no such thing as a pocket without a hole in it, is there? I’m sure you can find space for this somewhere in there.” The fine, looping lines etched into the watch lid danced as she turned it over in her hand. “Do not disquiet yourself with fear of getting caught. Let me worry about that.”

The woman glanced about, hesitation dwelling in the lines of her face as the line moved up. Constance looked up at the sky, the sapphire light peeking through the deep blue clouds reduced to veins.

“Time is running out.” Her gaze fell from the sky and alighted on the woman’s eyes, in them greed and fear battling one another. “So, what will it be?”

“You must think me mad if you suppose I’ll open this crate and put you inside,” she said, and Constance’s heart hammered in her ears, her mind whirring as it began to weigh options. But then the woman glanced askance, speaking without meeting her gaze. “But if anything were to happen to my cargo while my back is turned… well… I can’t be expected to check the boxes every time I look away, can I?“

Relief flourished in Constance’s smile. “Indeed. And who wouldn’t be distracted by a shiny watch abandoned in the middle of the street?”

The fleeting grin she flashed her was the last thing Constance saw as the woman turned away. She placed the watch and the coat on the lid of the linen crate and slid it aside carefully; but then she paused, addressing the woman one last time before crawling into the confined box. “Take the watch to Goldsmith Gus on West Street Four. He will pay you double what it is worth.”

Her world became dark and small as the lid slid back into place, trapping her inside. She closed her eyes, the change unnoticeable in the enveloping black. _No way out._ Seconds blurred into minutes. Splinters dug into her back, her breath shallow, the air thinning inside the closed box. She wondered what Gus would do, watching the woman walk in with the watch. She wondered whether he would wait, thinking she would come, and say goodbye before she left. Pain and regret swelled in her heart, all but too heavy a burden to bear. She should have gone inside, should have said goodbye. She knew she should have, just as well as she knew it was too late.

The crate rattled on the cart as it moved on the uneven cobblestones. It stopped, then moved again, sounds muffled by the wood and the rattling. Time became indistinguishable, drowned in remorse and discomfort.

Then, something shifted in the air. A hundred tiny bells tinkled in Constance’s mind, an avalanche of moments tumbling toward one that mattered most. She felt it in her navel, as though gravity was warping around her, reality crumbling and restructuring itself. And then, just like that, it was gone.

She felt her weight shift as the crate rolled uphill, the muted din of the docks strangled by stillness, the darkness inside by an even deeper darkness.

And so, curled up in a crate on a ship she was not allowed to board, Constance found herself, at last, _free_. Free from Calron, from the chains of the life she had built for herself in Toll Marre, from the place she had called home for two decades.

Gods knew what waited ahead.
