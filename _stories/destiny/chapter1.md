Under the ashen sky, the eight companions stood watch as the ship straddled the roiling waters.

Destiny cut through the waves, red sails flogging the leaden air. Behind it, the prison trembled on the crags, drawing closer the mist that cloaked its rough facade. Ahead, on the crisp grey horizon, seethed a storm.

The weathered wood beneath San’s feet creaked, stained by mildew and brine, worn smooth by time and duty. The tang of metal on his tongue, energy crackled and crawled within the fabric of air. It whispered against his skin in a dance of needles, prickling. He shivered. It was an unsettling sensation, reaching out and finding something that belongs to you not quite the way you left it, not quite the way it should be. The intrusion sharpened the edge that had already been whetted by their escape, loosing phantom spiders down his spine.

He could try and dampen the effect, he supposed; but he would not step on Jongho’s toes. This was not his moment. He left the unfamiliar force untouched, focusing instead on his own task, willing the pregnant air to flood the sails, bearing Destiny forth.

Raging billows rose ahead of them, churning, spitting, frothing. Two foam-capped mountains to either side of the valley that charted their path, surging, ebbing, shifting forever with the languid yet ruinous power of water. They swelled and fell, lapping at them like the gnashing teeth of some divine beast. But the depression twixt the peaks remained clear, a sheltered cleft between the churning vastness of the steel gray seas.

San glanced at the figure silhouetted against the curtain of slate draped over the blue facade of the sky. The slender figure of a man dressed in the tattered rags of the prison, bloodied and stone-still as he faced the horizon. The shortest among them, and with the presence of a god.

Choi San was named a mountain from birth, but he felt more like a hillock at times, compared to Hongjoong. Their captain, at whose feet they had thrown their measly knives — more apt for buttering bread than for drawing blood — at his feet that day, all those years ago. Not that long, San found when he thought of it — three years, touching on four. Only, three years that had brought their world crashing down, a path that splintered to bits behind them no sooner than they took the next step. No return, no undoing of past deeds, not only the worst of which chased him in his nightmares.

San breathed, letting air fill him to course his veins and sharpen his mind. Not long now. The storm — Jongho’s storm — still fringed the horizon; in all but a few minutes, Destiny would catch up to it. Not the horizon, though. Never the horizon.

‘Once we are close enough, I will bring the waves to the rear to cover us. Bring the storm close, Jongho, but try not to interfere,’ Hongjoong ordered. He’d had to shout over the din of the sea as it was struck by an unnatural force — his unnatural force, thrashed and cleaved by a thing other than the wind, the only sovereign known to her til now. ‘Try to cut a path, a point of egress, but quickly; we need them to _see_ us vanish. And, Jongho? Be careful.’

‘I got it, Captain,’ Jongho said, though San didn’t miss the look their youngest angled at Hongjoong, eyes alight with sparks telltale of the destruction within. Bridled, barely. Bridled. But deadly.

Behind them, the prison trembled precariously on its crag. And so did San.

Moments trickled past, every breath an eon as the battered ship approached the storm. The gale wrapped itself around him in an embrace, warm and familiar if it weren’t for the strange touch of Jongho’s magic, whose influence doubled with every inch crossed.

San hated having to share the wind. What an odd notion, _sharing_ the wind, which should not be anybody’s to share. A thing unbent by the laws of people, a grander law unto itself. Yet, as San whispered, so it went, like clay at the hands of a master potter.

But now, a subject torn between two lords. San did not push against the storm but suffered it, nudging the ship through whatever gap in resistance he could find. There was no point in wasting precious energy fighting one another.

‘Ready.’ Hongjoong’s voice was a croak through the strain. As promised, the waves climbed behind them, a looming bulwark like smoke-grey marble shot with white, ready to fall upon them, bringing near-certain ruin in the blink of an eye. But instead it towered over them, a fortified wall designed to protect, if only for a few moments longer than it should. Short enough to hide within the cracks in time that appear in those instants, which stretch on forever, those breathless moments that herald disaster. San knew, however, this was no trick of time, no play on perception. No illusion. Only magic, not unlike the kind pulsating within him at the very moment, coaxing air into obedience much in the same way Hongjoong did to the waters.

Power burning through, San nudged the ship through the opening Jongho left for him, barely visible amidst the wrath of the tempest.

And the world turned upside down.

The angel Vedriel hated prawns, and her day was bit by bit going worse for it.

It was a pleasant-enough day on the isle of Sera Cortanza, the little holm that housed the estate of the Prime Seat, separating the two prongs of the river that sundered the sparkling capital. The afternoon sun was bright and charitable in its bestowing of light, which shone upon the city and sluiced through the gleaming roofs of the many glasshouses strewn across it. From the easternmost district hemmed in by the lesser temples, to the west gate where the sprawling estates of the wealthiest and most renowned families reared their heads over one another to glimpse at the grand palace, the entire town buzzed with the joyous humor of a clement day. From her vantage point on the fourth-floor terrace of His Majesty’s seraglio, Vedriel could see, just beyond the southern tine of Avatoria, a crowd milling about the broad avenue lined with giant boutiques. Their bright façades dazzled the sight, freshly lacquered in the newest tones concocted by the chromatists guild, whose vehement assurances promised to catch the eye in ways that the previous hues could only dream of. At this rate, the guild would not stop until all of Cortanza became entranced in some utterly unproductive vigil overseeing the southern bank.

“Prawns?”

Vedriel’s attention snapped back to the man seated across her, his light blue robes cascading in swaths of silk quivering in the light breeze that stirred her own starlight-blond hair. His was a face more youthful than his sixty years, whitish-gray barely creeping up his temples. The esteemed cardinal Caeso Lurio, Seal of the Prime Seat and Archdeacon of Greater Casina, who had entertained countless guests of varying importance in His Majesty’s name since his appointment, hero of banquets and prospective martyr of feasts.

“No, thank you.”

“I hope you don’t mind if I..?” Gentle rhetoric, of course; the prawns were halfway to his plate before he had even uttered the first word.

“Please.” Vedriel’s hand made a magnanimous gesture, which highlighted Cardinal Caeso’s chivalrous demeanor as he, in a matching feat of magnanimity, refrained from pointing out just how much he cared about her permission. _Fuck-all-_much, to be perfectly precise.

“I must admit your petition was a bit unexpected,” he said, relishing the prawns. “His Majesty is quite busy, as I’m sure you’ll understand.”

“Naturally.”

“Of course, I am more than happy to accommodate you here. Now, your circumstances are somewhat unusual in nature, and I must confess some hesitation on my part.”

“What about my circumstances? I’m sure your qualms are nothing I cannot put to rest.”

“Ah… Yes, I don’t doubt that they are not.” He paused to put his fork down, however, a heretofore unprecedented gesture. “It’s only that, as you must know, there is, ah, well, some history between your distinguished patron and His Majesty.”

“What better reason is there, my friend,” Vedriel said smoothly, “for His Majesty to allow me the honor of his company?”

“Of course, His Majesty holds in high regard the, ah, kinships he has shared in the past. His Majesty is not one to forget or one to withhold gratitude. However, as His Seal, I feel obligated to divulge to you that His Majesty feels… betrayed.”

“Betrayed?”

“He feels that apologies are in order.”

Vedriel sighed, impatience creeping out of her despite her best efforts. This had been a gamble, one she had calculated and decided to take. Torean, wrapped up in his self-importance, had not granted Vedriel’s plea for an audience with him. And perhaps it was her own annoyance at the God, which had given Vedriel the idea to turn to his ancient rival Oreus instead, hoping that a supposed envoy from Torean might arouse his interest enough to lend her half an ear. And it had, well enough for Oreus to grant him _an_ audience, though not with himself directly. But even if Vedriel was willing to pose as Torean’s envoy, she had no intention of stirring the waters; and she had the feeling a false apology on Torean’s behalf might do just that. It was not only a question of whether Vedriel could get away with it, as high as it was among her chief concerns. A renewal of hostilities between the two would almost surely spill over, as the games of gods often did.

“And they will be given if deemed appropriate,” she said at last.

“Appropriate?”

“Suitable.”

The cardinal’s gaze told her he had not found her response very appropriate or suitable, as it happened.

“Cardinal Lurio — Caeso, if I may? Just between two loyal servants who only wish to serve their masters well… My patron has, despite his natural inclinations that we mortals cannot comprehend nor judge, shown you and your master enough deference despite their differences, to extend the figurative olive branch, and sent me here as a token of goodwill. And I do not ask that you forgive him. I do not ask that you concede. I only ask for a modicum of His Majesty’s time, as the mediator, to pay my respects and to harken to his wisdom. Will His Majesty deny me the honor, turn a blind eye to the winds of good faith that brought me here?”

Caeso Lurio chewed, an appraising look on his youthful face, before turning back to his plate with an amused yet unimpressed smile. “Oratory is a subtle art, Miss Caravaglio, and I commend your artistry. Unfortunately, my master in his _wisdom_ was quite clear and precise with his wording; and he left no loops for me to hop through. I have been instructed to receive you and to hear you out, but to accept no less than a pledge for a formal apology to be delivered at the next council. It is with much regret that I must turn you down; but unless you are ready to make that pledge, I suggest we enjoy the lovely day and the lovelier company before I accompany you back to the grand entrance.” Then, with a satisfied smile, he reached for the gilt samovar at the center of the table. “Now, how about tea?”

From the darkness erupted the bright red glare of fury.

It was the kind of all-consuming gloom that sought, enveloped, and choked; more _nothingness_ than the mere absence of light. A shifting, pulsing mess, thick like tar and constantly expanding with a wicked hunger.

Trapped in a prison of flesh, a cage of iron in the exact shape of his body, Jongho tried to stir. Still as a corpse, and blind as one too — he did not know whether it was the complete and utter darkness that swathed him, or whether his lids had petrified to stone like the rest of him. He knew no name to call himself by, felt no heart beating within his chest. At that moment, he knew only the fury that burned through him, searing, blazing, devouring.

_Out,_ his own voice growled in his mind, low, raspy, inhuman. More a sound of nature’s wrath than the voice of a man — a rumble of crashing rocks, a rush of sky-high flames. A storm cracking his whips of bright white light, blinding and deafening all at once.

_I must get out._

Then, though his body slumbered, his soul roared, unleashing fury. His was a fury unadulterated.
