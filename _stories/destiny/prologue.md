Dawn found Dusk at the Hall Outside of Time. Waiting, as Dusk did.

Garbed only in moonlit water gliding off her body in a never-ending cascade, her glittering crown of stars filled the empty atrium with pale light that cast shifting shadows against the blind arcade. As he entered, his warm luminescence melded with it, and at once a million sparks erupted mid-air under the vaulted dome of the structure, a swirl of glinting dust, which danced and twirled and rained down upon them in a miracle of radiance and divine beauty. Miracles, like Gods brought about. Gods, like Dusk and Dawn, for whom this resplendent display was something more akin to a party trick than thaumaturgy.

Dawn strode forward to meet his peer, his steps slow, but strong and assured. Now alive with his brilliance, the gilded walls of the chapel burst alight with refracted daylight, painting the shower of tiny lights all the colors of the universe.

Dusk smiled, the universe reflected in her eyes.

“Do you remember when we first built this place and you wanted to name it ‘The Present’?”

And of course, Dawn remembered, as Dawn did.

“Seemed fitting, at the time.” A smile as dazzling as the sun graced his face. “I guard the past, you the future; neither you nor I rule the present. Like this hall. Here, neither reigns. A place to simply exist.”

“Such is the nature of your curse, the curse of your nature,” she said, her voice a lullaby. “You lack the foresight to guess the answer.”

“But I cannot escape the hindsight to live in blissful ignorance of it, I know. I remember.”

“Surely you do.” Dusk echoed his smile, and offered Dawn her hand. “Come.”

Hand in hand they crossed the way to the arched gate opposite the entrance, emerging onto the balcony overlooking the infinite vastness of a place untethered to the rest of the realm, it was a pocket in the cosmos, sealed by ancient magic, there were no cracks for time to seep through. The gallery overlooked a canvas of beauty ethereal, a sky with no horizon but the sun and the moon, facing one another from either end. To their right was the moon on her throne, overseeing her dominion of deepest black night, like the hearts of evil men, pierced only by a collection of constellations tenfold as majestic as the spectacle inside the hall, the skirts of her gown, woven from threads of twilight, spilling over her seat of night. To their left, a blazing sun of molten gold, gliding over the world. Caught between them was a sky of neither dusk nor dawn, but both at once, the clouds at odds with each other over the matter of color, each with an intent to prove its own the godliest of hues.

“I found him,” Dusk said without preamble, though only after what felt like some minutes during which they gazed wordlessly at their impossible scenery.

Dawn said nothing, letting the warmth of the sun tickle his dark skin.

“His is a fate most dire,” she continued. “Filled with glory and power, with victory and love and treasures untold.”

“A fate that has cursed many, I should know.”

“Indeed.”

Stillness washed over them once more, the peace of simply existing.

“I will miss this place,” said Dawn. He glanced at her, then, sideways, for the first time since they had come out. “Will I miss this place?”

Dusk gave him nothing more than a knowing smile. But then, his was simple rhetoric. He would not miss this place, as he would not miss anything. For one had to remember in order to miss.

What an odd notion, not remembering. He would not be Dawn anymore, as he would not remember as Dawn did.

He turned to glance at the imposing structure over his muscled shoulder, a wonder of creation erected in the naive arrogance of youth, an assuming ode to themselves, by themselves. Back then the world they had made ground beneath their feet had seemed a much bigger place, their eyes still on the horizon, hungry hearts feverish with anticipation. Six spires piercing the forever-sky, one for each of them, standing guard over the lofty domes of their hallowed halls. This view of their seat of power was only a rendition, however, made to reflect the real thing, though it was not physically there. Even the Six’s palace did not exist outside of time, unlike this place here. Here was their sanctuary, his and Dusk’s; a haven for the Guardians of Time.

“Have you decided, then?” he asked as he trained his attention back on the view beyond the gallery.

“I have”, Dusk said. “And I would ask for your helping hand.”

“You have decided to meddle, after all, have you?”

“I am hoping it doesn’t come to that. But yes. He will need guidance. And I owe him this, if not the world.”

“You really think it will come to that?”

“I fear so.”

Sensing the pregnant air in Dusk’s pause, Dawn swallowed whatever reply he was about to give, letting her mull over the unvoiced trepidations brewing within.

“I… I have this feeling, Erywenes, this feeling of dread that I cannot shake off when I turn my gaze upon what is to come. I fear that this will not be the end, though I am certain we have made the right choice. It terrifies me that we may be powerless to stop what is to come.”

“We are not almighty, Averina. We never have been. Not alone, and not together. Sometimes the best we can do is just that.”

“What a wise man you can be, Erywenes, when the answer is not to my liking.”

“So I do my measly part, share half the glory with a shade of the work.” Dawn shifted, the still, timeless light of the false sun capering along the smooth surface of his coronet. His bare chest, too, glowed, Dusk’s wan, bluish glow tinting the defined muscles. “There lived a man once who had three sons and an empire, and wanted no less than the world itself. He summoned the best diviner in the land so that he may know his fortunes. Now, she was a woman true to her art, who had the gift that let her peek beyond the veil; but she was also shrewd and worldly, and her reputation preceded her as it did in this case. Warily, yet proudly she came to his court, answering his summons, where she was received like a queen.

“A feast was held in her name on the night of her arrival. They dined and drank and made merry, and it is said that the River Han itself, which ran through the capital of his empire, flowed with the finest wine instead of its clear blue waters. The next night, the second son threw a ball in her honor, and the whole city danced and sang until dawn. On the third night, the emperor gathered his most esteemed in his throne room, where the diviner was to, at last, read the stars that foretold his future greatness.

“The woman took a look at the man, another at the clear night sky with its thousand glimmering jewels, and declared: “By no man nor god shall you be felled. The world will stand, led by your hand, when shadow falls upon the land. And the earth shall break to welcome you, with open arms as men kneel to honor you. And you will live on for eons to come, for there will be none other who carries the truth, till you depart with a world made anew behind you.”

“Oh dear.”

“And so he began his conquests, commanded forth his armies to lay siege to the nearby cities, then again once they were won. Campaign by victorious campaign he fought, and he conquered, fear of his name spread like wildfire to the very coasts of the continent. Some surrendered in terror; others stood against him till their last heroic breath. But everywhere he went he brought entire nations to their knees, at times whatever remnants of them still prevailed. Or so it was until he, at last, came upon the borders of another great ruler - though the great empire dwarfed his kingdom, this king reigned over it with an iron fist and a sharp mind. All over the continent did those who were subdued and those who lived in fear thereof look to him with hope, their fates tied to this hero who might just put an end to the expansion of the growing empire.

“The emperor, as he often did, sent an emissary to the king as their forces lined up against one another in a state of peace as fragile as the finest glass, ready to shatter at the word of either ruler.

A day he waited, and just as the sun was setting, under a sky awash with red, he saw a rider crest the hill before them. A box he carried with him spoke of the small treasure he had requested and readily he let the rider through into his camp. But this box contained no treasure; instead, he opened it to find the severed head of his emissary inside.

Irate, he ordered the full force of his army upon the kingdom. But the king’s army retaliated, a resistance the likes of which they had never encountered.

For three days they fought, and for three days neither line moved, a boundary of violence and loss, of heat and smoke and bloodshed to no end. At last, the emperor, tiring of the wait in his wrathful impatience and spiteful at the opposition he had not faced until this day, sent another emissary to the king, challenging him to a duel. Again at sunset, a rider crested the hill, and though the emperor saw the box carried by the rider, he ordered his army to let him through. When the rider dismounted to hand him the box, however, he found within it not the decapitated head of his emissary but the terms of the accepted duel. And so the two armies ceased combat, anxiously awaiting the duel which was to take place at noon, still wary of any surprise attacks that may come in the night. None came.

“In the meantime, the two rulers prepared for the duel, and, as the burning sun approached the zenith of its path in the skies, a crowd gathered at the dueling ground, the air shimmering with anticipation. But the emperor wasn’t there, and the three sons apologized to the king, promising to retrieve their absent father lest the slaughter recommence.

“So the three sons went to their father’s tent to find him, where they found his lifeless corpse.” He paused for a second, turning to relish the expectant expression on Dusk’s beautiful face. “It was the shits.”

Dusk stared at him, his widening smile eliciting a groan followed by a wayward chuckle. “And what does this have to do with anything?”

“Nothing,” Dawn said. “But it made you laugh.”

With a sigh, her attention pivoted back to the unchanging sunrise-sunset of their mock sky of wonders and Dawn knew the distraction of his story had already washed away. So fleeting was the present — there for a moment and gone the next, crushed under the infinite weight of the future, another pebble hurled under the ever-growing mountain of the past. Caught between two eternities, a single juncture that neither of them swayed.

“If the day ever does dawn that we must face what I fear we must, I hope he is ready for it.”

“If that day ever dawns, I doubt anyone could be if you see what comes to pass.”

“Which is why we must help.”

“And we will, if you see it fit.”

When Dusk glanced at him from the corner of her eye, he was holding two goblets produced from what seemed to be thin air, filled with something swirling with a density of gold. She took the one he proffered to her, a sweet scent cut with the bite of some exotic spice tickling her nose as the steam rose from within.

“To him, then, for what he must shoulder.”

“To him,” said Dusk. Sorrow bled through, into her voice. “I am sorry.”
