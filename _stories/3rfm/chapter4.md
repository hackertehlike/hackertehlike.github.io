In the carnival that was not a carnival, the revelries continued in full swing.

Under the great glittering night sky tenfold as resplendent as the jewel-decked crowd, a choir of nightingales trilled in the air, leading the dancing raiment. The merry-go-round turned and turned and turned to the tune of the dream's song, its variegated lights glinting off silk, diamonds, and tears of joy. To one side the press of incorporeal guests stretched beyond sight, spinning and whirling and cavorting. From it rose the tinkle of gold and laughter, the _swoosh_ of skirts and capes. To the other, the very hues of the universe unraveled, glowing, interweaving. The endless prairie was steeped in merry evernight.

Irena's feet caught in her dress, making her stumble. She was wearing the pale green dress she had ordered from Bogena, the spidersilk sleeves soft and slightly cool to the touch, the beads incandescent with the hues of the universe's lights. On Halora, the moonglow was breathtaking, bathed in the Aetherial Quill's silver light dampened by the mists of Terreter. In the carnival that was not a carnival, the unadulterated starlight made the lace divine.

Of course, here, there were no gazes to be drawn by Irena's gown. Save the one.

Irena watched the feather-frocked figure's head turn slowly toward herself, too stunned to move.

_Watching._

Irena flinched, unsure whether the voice had been her own, or somebody else's, or even human. She could not remember whether it had the gentle lilt of a lullaby or the grating caw of carrion birds.

_I must do… something._

That, for sure, had been hers. But Irena could not remember what that _something_ ought to be. She closed her eyes, though that did nothing to ward off the rising melody, all too aware of the beady eyes still trained on her.

_Think, Irena.  What is it that you must do?_

The melody came crashing down, all at once, as a thousand pairs of shoes met the ground at the same split second exactly.

Irena opened her eyes.

_Istikbal. I must talk to Istikbal._

She gathered her skirts, turning her back on the feather-frocked figure fore the merry-go-round, and ran.

The cavern trembled, the stalactites threatening to fall. The divine aura was present here, wrapped around Irena, crowded into the nooks and crannies of the jagged rock that trapped her inside. A familiar embrace, as the deity's essence gathered about her, greeting the sliver of its like lodged within her.

She fell to her knees, her skin breaking as it met the rough stone. Blood gushed out to wet the surface in tribute of her worship as did her words. "I am yours, Istikbal."

_Irena._

She swallowed, waiting for more; but only the whispers of her own words echoed in the hollow cavern.

"I…" Irena trailed off, her voice diminishing, her breath rising in puffs of white mist. She had not noticed the cold, for she was already shivering. She swallowed. "I need your assistance, Istikbal."

_Assistance._

Irena gathered her skirts in her palm to steady her hands, feeling the tension in her chest thaw ever slightly. "I am… I… My position at the Academy is… precarious."

_Be careful._

"Well, yes," Irena stammered awkwardly. "That is why I need your assistance."

_Assistance, yes._

Irena breathed, her hungry heart hammering against her ribs; and hope, against all odds, seeping through the cracks of worry. The goddess's lilt was distant and echoed, as though altered by its voyage through time, yet Irena could feel Istikbal's eyes on herself, judging, weighing. Disappointment, Irena felt, was imminent.  "Yes."

_I need your assistance._

"...Wait, what?" Her tongue had moved before her mind did, and her stupor was great enough to momentarily fend off the shivering.

_He grows stronger. Do not let him._

"Who grows stronger, Istikbal?"

The goddess's presence shook the earth, dust and rubble raining down. _He will bring the heavens down upon you. You alone can wield the sword that undoes._ Then, like candlelight being blown out, it vanished.

Irena hurtled through darkness.

Shattering glass rent the night, pain ripping through Irena.

Warmth melded with the white-hot agony frosting on its edges, an impossible duality. Darkness reigned.

So this was what eternal rest was like. An egregious misnomer, as it was not particularly restful.

The sound from Irena's lungs as they sucked in a sharp breath sliced through the eternal rest that was not particularly restful, and jerked her back to the realms of the living. White hot agony prevailed still, as did the darkness; but there were other things there, like the sliver of silver light stealing in through the slice of open curtain, or the wetness that made cloth stick to her skin and the stale air of the room crawl across it with a slight chill in its wake. Pain was effective at dispersing the remnant haze in her mind; and so the stardust strewn across the universe resolved into shards of glass on her floor, moonlight distilled by the crystal shards tinsel-like on the dark wood. She became acutely aware of the rivulets streaming down her hands and dripping onto her nightgown, explaining the warmth and the wetness.

"Krijk's Beak," Irena cursed, throwing the blanket off herself, and shifted to the edge of her bed, looking for her slippers. The broken glass crunched under her soles as she crossed to her washbasin. She must have knocked over the glass of water on her nightstand when she had jolted awake, cutting her hand open. At least the sharper pain had left little room for the throbbing headache that welcomed her every morning; but now that the pain was easing ever slightly she could feel it at the back of her skull, lurking, prowling, waiting.

She focused on the stinging pain of her open wound, and the coolness of the running water as she cleaned it. It needed a few layers of gauze if not stitching, and so she dressed herself as swiftly as she could, and set off for the infirmary for the first time in her several weeks of unpleasant awakenings.

The morning seemed, at first glance, that of an ordinary Prosperity Day. Students freckled the vaulted halls, persuaded by the chilly mountain air to cross open courtyards with haste, the constellations on their capes twinkling as the heavy fabric swished behind them. Shortly before the eighth bell, those with classes soon beginning were making their way toward their auditoria, the first years as well as the more academically inclined engrossed in their last-minute revision.

This morning, however, there was a buzz in the air filling the dark stone interior of the Main Building that did not grace most others — a hint of anticipation, sharp focus cast out by the suspense of the eve to come. Already the first signs of ball preparation were making their debuts, ringlets slept on from the night before, freshly cut hair, and manicured nails abundant. Reservation slots for the only barbershop in town had been booked weeks ago by auction; in the scarcity, the more cosmetically gifted students offered their services in exchange for gold, commodities, and information, the Academy’s main currency. The undercurrent of war and cunning was replaced by all the trivia necessitated by glitz and glamour.

Irena found herself almost smiling as she ambled toward the Greenhouse. She had the morning off, as was usually the case on Prosperity Days; and the painkillers August Taynev had given her for her hand had quelled her headache.

Tomorrow, she would have to go back to the world of knives and whispers.

Today, she would enjoy her coffee and crepe, take a nap, then slip into the slippers of a fairytale princess, and step into a world where masquerade was a fancy word for glittering gowns, and magic a stolen waltz with a dashing prince.

The Greenhouse was a long structure with a glass roof and a row of cafes on both sides. On spring days when the sun lounged in its blue garden and the new bloom happily basked in its light, the tables and chairs were a prime spot for studying and scheming. On days like this, however, seven weeks into the semester with the turn of winter imminent, the weather atop Mount Terreter was inhospitable, driving the crowd inside.

Irena browsed her options, from pies and cakes and pastries to omelets and sandwiches, overwhelmed by choice.

_Pick something. It’s just breakfast._

“…anyway I’m thinking of asking Chae — Irena!”

Irena whirled around to find Hyunjin standing three paces away, flanked by her sister, Yeji, and Soobin.

“Ah, hey guys.”

“Are you here alone?” Hyunjin asked. “Join us. We’re getting rice.”

“Uh, sure,” Irena said. “How are you doing?”

“Yeah, pretty good,” Hyunjin said as they started toward the rice shop. “Are you excited?”

“For?”

“Tonight, of course. What else?”

“Oh, yeah, sure. Of course,” Irena said, flashing him a teasing smile. “Do you have a date?”

“No—”

“He was going to ask Wonyoung, but Songhoon got there first,” said Yeji.

“Yeji!” Hyunjin protested, reddening at the cheeks as he elbowed his sister.

“Oh, I won’t tell a soul,” Irena said. “But hold on, I thought Wonyoung rejected Songhoon’s invitation.”

“She did, but she also said it was not because of Songhoon but she just wants to go with her friends.”

“It’s for the better, Hyun,” said Soobin. “You don’t want the ire of half of the Academy’s male population.”

Hyunjin shrugged. “Can’t be worse than last year. At least they can’t get me expelled anymore.”

“They can always get you expelled,” Yeji said. “Maybe not as easily without the Quasar; but where there is a will, there is a way.”

“And you two?” Irena turned to Soobin and Yeji as they sat down outside the rice shop, warm steam from its kitchen already seeping out into the corridor. “Are either of you going with someone?”

Irena didn’t miss the softening buzz coming from Soobin’s direction, the sensory equivalent of peachy pink as Yeji answered, her head cocking toward Soobin. “He is going with Seonghwa.”

“Yeji!” Soobin protested.

Yeji shrugged. “It’s cute. Sorry. I’m going stag, though.”

“Ah,” Irena glanced over at her, donning all manner of nonchalance as she harkened to the whispers of Yeji’s mind. Not a single stray thread of thought escaped her mental fortress, leaving Irena with nothing. Her face betrayed nothing, perfectly in accord with her mind. “Me too.”

_Don’t bring up Ryujin. Don’t bring up Ryujin. Don’t bring up Ryujin._

“I heard there is a first-year who declared himself today,” Hyunjin cut in, answering her prayers, as he opened the door of the tiny box attached to their table. “Shrimp for you, Yeji, and chicken for Soob, right? What do you want, Irena?”

“Plain rice, please,” Irena said. “Oh? It’s not even the ninth bell. He should have waited a couple more hours if he wanted the news to get lost amid ball preparations.”

“Yes, so what do we think?” Yeji asked. “A Jungkook, or a halfwit?”

Every year there were a few first-years who dared, fancying themselves capable of surmounting the First Trials and the Quasars at the same time. Whether prodigies or idiots, though more likely to be the latter, there would be no way to tell until the dust settled.

“Halfwit — that’s my bet. I’ve seen plenty of those strutting around; Jungkook was something else. I still thank my stars he did it in our first year. I remember sitting in class the first week and being terrified whenever he asked a question and I did not even understand a word of it. I don’t know if I would have survived my Trials if he’d done it last year.”

“Didn’t you win every battle?” Yeji asked. “You would have, Hyun. The Trials only cull the weak.”

Irena felt her mind go still before it started reeling. At once she dropped the portcullis on her thoughts, exerting her willpower down to its last dregs to keep herself from glancing over at Yeji. If her brother’s success was any measure to judge by, Hwang Yeji was a threat Irena did not wish to come up against, and the flash of silver in her words, she hoped, was no blade’s edge.

“It’s not even the ninth bell and we haven’t even had breakfast,” said Soobin, and Irena sent Istikbal another prayer for the save. If this was Istikbal’s apology for whatever had happened last night, Irena was willing to take it. “Can you two shut up about school for a second?”

Hyunjin shrugged as Irena felt a little smile tug on her lips. Just in time, too, as the metal box dinged and lit up.

“That’s fair,” Yeji said nonchalantly as she reached for her bowl. “So how do you think tonight’s going to go with Seonghwa?”

“Good,” Soobin shot back. “Hopefully I’ll finish burying your body by then.”
