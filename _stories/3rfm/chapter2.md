At the edge of the universe, the carnival that isn’t a carnival wheeled about Irena in a tempest of chroma and music. A light breeze breathed on her sweaty skin, stirring wind chimes somewhere off in the distance. Her dress caught the iridescent lights of the carnival that isn't a carnival and became alive with hues unknown to her world.

She began to walk toward the figure before the carousel, weaving her way through the merry crowd. The person decked in feathers kept ever out of reach, slippered feet slipping on grass without delivering on its promise of taking her where she meant to go.

The jamboree carried on in full swing around her, dancing pairs whirling in a swoosh of silk and chiffon. Laughter bubbled far and near. They all laughed, all but the person in front of the carousel.

She didn’t. Her face was hidden by a mask, her figure swathed in too many layers of feathers to hint at her frame. Irena could not see that she was, in fact, a she; only _knew_. She kept running toward her, quickening her pace. A sweet scent hung in the air, thickening in its cloying intensity the nearer she came. Only, she did not come any nearer.

_Irena._ Irena blinked, step faltering. Her body tugged at her to turn to the source of the sound. But Irena wasn’t sure there had been a source. Had it been her ears that had heard, or her mind? Thinking back, she wasn’t even sure it had been a human voice. A bird, perhaps.

She blinked again. And just like that, the lady in the feathers was gone. Irena stopped to look about herself, and found naught changed. Still, the pairs spun merrily — pairs of dresses, beings merely of cloth and no flesh. There were no bodies to fill the elaborate gowns and glittering tuxedos, no hands interlocked in dance. No faces crowned the jiving garments. The laughter that was far and near escaped no lips, no teeth flashed brightly in the bright lights of the carnival that wasn’t a carnival.

Irena looked up, stripping her gaze away from the frolicking raiment. The sky at the edge of the universe was bejeweled with entire galaxies on display, variegated, more radiant than the finest glass.

_Irena._ Irena blinked again. She stood now on a bridge with only enough light to see five paces ahead and that much behind, and no more. Both ends of the bridge extended beyond the sphere of illumination into the shadows, and darkness alone occupied above and below.

_Irena._

She trembled, and so did the ground. The voice had not come from any one direction – it had come from all of them, an omnipresent rumble that had sounded more like an avalanche of boulders than a human.

Irena sank to the floor. Pain flared through her as the rough ground cut open her knees, glistening blood wetting the stone. "I am yours, Istikbal."

_I see you, Irena._

"Your eyes see much, Istikbal. What is your wish? Name it, and your bidding I shall do. I am your knife, and you are my eyes."

_I watch you, Irena._

"Yes," Irena said, trying to stifle the awkwardness that bloomed within. The goddess was often cryptic, but seldom so stingy with words. Why had she brought her here?

The silence stretched on, and Irena sat on the stone bridge, waiting. Vaguely she became aware of her dress – the very same one she had been wearing at the carnival that was not a carnival, but now wrinkled, its hems fraying in places.

_Do not trust him._

Though Irena's lips parted readily, she paused, questions flocking into her head. Him? "Whom should I distrust, Istikbal?"

_The darkest night is when he reigns._

Irena swallowed down questions, more questions, waiting. The air stirred around her, and she shivered again.

&nbsp;_He will bring the heavens down upon you._

Shadows curled about, twisting and weaving into figures too dark to discern. Faceless silhouettes veiled in gloom stared at her, watching.

_Now go, Irena. And may your eyes see with truesight._

At the edge of the universe, a man sat inside a carriage. This carriage had no wheels. This carriage had no driver. It was a thing painted sky-blue, glazed with glossy varnish, pulled by a single white horse that never rested. The horse, too, was varnished, though the red saddle was worn and matted in places.

The carousel had not escaped the fate that had claimed the rest of the carnival. Bright lights had taken hold of the thing, dazzling constellations of color blinking like fireflies as the carousel turned to the tune.

The man paid no heed to the crowd, nor did he seem to notice the feather-frocked figure standing by the carousel. Instead, his eyes combed the skies, his face a white mask against all the colors of the universe.

The feather-frocked figure stirred sharply, her neck twisting back — far too back — like an owl’s; if she was pained by the motion, she did not show it.

The sky-blue carriage on the carousel at the edge of the universe was empty. 

&nbsp;

Reeling from a dream, Irena jolted on her bed, a sharp sting stabbing the back of her head. Sweat had pooled in the valleys of her face, her nightgown clinging to her back. She pushed herself up on all fours and reached for the bucked beside her bed.

Shivers crawled up and down her body as she vomited.

She willed her legs to carry her to the washroom, cutting through the dark of the night without light. The cold water kissed her skin, icy fingers rolling down her neck. Holding on to the basin, she forced herself to stand despite the pain raining on her needle by piercing needle.

Only the wan blue light of the Aetherial Quill seeped through the narrow window of the washroom. It was another night where the clouds had painted the stars away, an increasingly common occurrence in recent weeks. Judging by the moon’s standing, morning had some hours yet to arrive.

Fighting the urge to crawl, Irena dragged herself back to bed. But the idea of lying down unsettled her, even more so than it had the previous nights. She did not know if she could make it anywhere with this pain, but the room’s suffocating air weighed on her, threatening. Cursing, she leaned against her desk chair, her vision blurring. Searing pain struck her once more, and she buckled over, feeling bile rise.

The bucket, her mind muttered; but the bucket beside the bed would not rush to her aid. Covering her mouth with her sleeve, she retched. A warmth spread up and down her arm through the cloth, wet, sticky, her nostrils filled with the bitter scent, the acrid sting of it still in her gullet.

Air, her mind pleaded. She stepped backward, back flaring with more pain as she crashed into the door, hand grasping for the handle.

The full force of her weight was enough to throw the door open, and Irena found herself face to face with the floor, the marble cold under her hands and knees.

Infirmary? No. Roaming dreams was common enough among Mindwalkers – but not the kind that brought you to your knees night after night, vomiting from the gut-rending pain.

With shallow breaths, she pressed a hand against the wall for support and pushed herself up. Step by agonizing step she made for the stairs, one wrong moment away from regorging the last remnants of her dinner. Every footfall echoed in the cavernous emptiness of the hall, amplified tenfold by the dead silence.

The parlor downstairs was vacant, which was unsurprising, but not a given. Her stomach still in rebellion, Irena threw herself onto the sofa closest to the fireplace. Sleep drummed in her eye sockets with a low, steady beat; but the splitting headache that had awoken her eclipsed it, drilling into her skull.

A pattern danced against the dark backdrop of her closed lids. It was a pattern of pain – bright and variegated, like the sky at the edge of the universe. Irena winced at the recollection. A phantom melody played in her ears, a familiar rondo that echoed off the corners of her mind, invading her thoughts. Her stomach churned to the rhythm.

_Hush,_ she begged her mind. _Shut up. Please._

Her mind could not hear her over the music, it seemed.

Irena groaned, frustration encasing her. First light hid in its lair, indolent, sinister, unreachable. Perhaps it was for the better; for she was in no state to remove herself from the couch, let alone go to class and attend to her duties. But these waking hours during which agony guarded the doors to the vale of dreams, stone-rigid and unmovable, felt little better.

Adjusting the cushions she repositioned herself, sinking into the down sofa. The large parlor was too spacious to be heated by the thin flames in the fireplace, chills creeping on her skin slick with cold sweat. Yet, reaching within, Irena could not find the strength to move to stoke the fire. She curled up, pulling the pillows closer, and started counting.

When footsteps pulled her out of her half-daze, the sky seemed to be more or less how she'd left it. A figure marred her blurry vision, and stepped back, startled.

"Oh, I'm sorry.” A male voice, ringing with hesitance. "Did I wake you?"

"You didn't," Irena sighed.

"Are you alright?"

"Yeah." Irena sat up, managing it somehow despite her shaking arms. "Yeah, I'm alright."

"I'm sorry. I didn't think anyone would be here."

"It's alright. No one should be here at this hour."

The boy smiled, and she looked at him – really looked at him, for the first time. His linen shirt hung loosely on him, his black hair unruly; but what struck Irena’s attention was his eyes. Catlike and upward-tilting, they should have made him appear intense. Intimidating. But the boy staring at Irena radiated a youthful innocence, his dimpled smile untouched by the Academy's cutthroat influence.

"First year?"

He nodded.

"I can't say I envy you."

"I get that," he said, seemingly unfazed by the comment. "What about you? Second year?"

"That's right."

The fire in the hearth filled the room with the musk of burning wood, but still no heat.

“So, what's your story?" Irena asked.

"My story?"

"Yeah, your story. You know… How did you end up here?"

"I couldn't sleep." And he seemed to have tried.

"I meant," Irena said with a small smile, "How did you end up here?"

"Ah." The boy chuckled, his dimples deepening. "It's not exactly punishment, is it?"

Irena cocked her head at that. "I suppose not."

Crackling fire infused the silence as he paused, pensive, and Irena felt her mind reach out to his. Tiredness would have lowered his defenses, making it easy to penetrate through the barriers of his already unguarded mind. But the mind-numbing exhaustion that wrapped around her like a leaden cloak extended to her imaginary limbs. Trying to grasp his threads of thought was like trying to touch the clouds.

"It was my uncle who noticed my powers. I was… twelve, perhaps thirteen. One day he took me to a…" he trailed off, and Irena saw hesitation cross his feline eyes if she didn't feel it mentally. "Well, I guess I'm not supposed to tell you that story. Anyhow. Soon after we were visited by two men who made sure this was kept under wraps. Nothing scary – only, they made my parents and uncle take some kind of oath. And I was told to wait until I was of age, to come here and begin my education. So… Here I am."

"You're barely of age?” Irena blurted, her brows shooting up despite herself. “You’ve got balls, kid.”

"I’m not that much younger than everyone. Besides, I’ve had way longer than most to grow into my power.”

“I suppose that’s fair.”

They stood for a moment, engulfed by the wordless silence imbued with the tender crackling of the hearth. Irena’s mind felt limp, sensing little. Every blink brought pain, a reminder of that which she yearned for — rest.

“So, the Trials…” He moved to lean against the sofa arm, his words imbued with an eagerness to fill the silence. “Any tips?”

Irena sighed, eyes unfocused. _Tips? Sell your soul to a goddess, I suppose._ Even then, she had made it through by the skin of her teeth.

“The First Trials, well… Work hard. As for the rest, I’m sure you’ve already heard all about how you should keep your secrets and play your hand and all that,” she said. “Work hard, be ruthless. Don’t trust anyone. The Quasar Trials are sooner than you think.”

A rueful smile tugged at the edges of his lips. “More or less.”

“Good advice, but incomplete. I don’t know if you’ve heard about the Brethren yet?”

“Oh, I’ve heard of them.”

“Not the only example, but the most famed. Some choose to ignore that advice to some extent. Alliances can be risky, but the reward is high if you can manage to reap them.”

“I suppose.”

“But… hey. Don’t quote me on that. More have lost everything by trusting the wrong people than won by finding the true few. Just… watch out for yourself, kiddo.”

“I’ll try. And thanks, I appreciate it.”

She gave him another smile, trying to instill encouragement into it, despite the exhaustion she felt down to her marrow. “And… don’t worry. You haven’t left yet; that’s a good sign.”

“But three quarters of us are yet to be chopped.”

“True and fair. But you seem like a smart one. You will figure it out. Besides… if worse comes to worst... you won’t even know it.”

“Thanks,” he said, the same words from a moment ago now glinting with sarcasm. “I appreciate it.”

"You are very welcome.” The dawn bells tolled, punctuating Irena’s reply. From beyond the windows came a flurry of wings as the birds of morning took to the air, riding the first winds of the day. “Maybe we should both try to get some shut-eye. A new day at the Academy awaits us both.”

“Sound judgment. And I will see you around, maybe?”

“Not unlikely,” Irena said, and turned to leave; but the boy’s voice cut her path short as he called after her.

“I didn’t catch your name, by the way.”

Glancing over her shoulder, she spoke into the cold of the room. “Irena.”

“Irena,” he repeated, as though trying the name out. “I’m Jungwon.”

“Jungwon,” she said, following suit. “Welcome to the Academy, kid.”

Then, with a wink and a final smile, she left him alone in the dingy emptiness of the common hall.

Heels clicking on the marble floor, Irena ran, swearing under her breath as she passed through the vaulted halls of the Main Building. Morning fog hung like a pall in the air, dew clinging to the withered weeds and bare branches in the garden. Irena’s cloak fluttered behind her, making her shirt stick to her back with sweat despite the cold.

Late again, this time by almost half a bell. As the double doors of the Australis Hall came into view she slowed for a second to catch her breath. Then, with a silent prayer to Istikbal for mercy, she entered the classroom.

“Ah, Mistress Vasiljev has finally deigned to join us on this fine morning. Welcome, Mistress. Could we get you a cup of tea? A breakfast roll, perhaps?”

It seemed Istikbal’s attention was elsewhere this morning.

“My apologies, August Feymar. It just so happened that I overslept.”

“And while you were sleeping, your armies were being crushed under the overwhelming force of the foe,” the old battle-master said. “Or worse, the assassin sent to your tent to snip off your thread of life found his job exceptionally easy to perform.”

Irena lowered her head, bowing slightly. “It will not happen again.”

“Not if you are already dead, it won’t. Now, if you could please take your seat, Mistress Vasiljev, we would be so very grateful for the pleasure of your company.”

Irena lumbered into the closest available seat on the fourth row as August Feymar stepped back up to the dais, turning slightly toward the blackboard. “Now… where were we? The Five Principles of War. Mistress Vasiljev, if you please..?”

“Objective, unity, security, surprise, and simplicity,” Irena recited, the words etched into the slate of her memory by the hammer that was the First Trials.

“Now, if you remember, you were all oh-so-disgruntled when I told you that the first year would be pure, standard war theory without a dash of magic.” He took a step forward, the flourish of his cape accompanying the spark in his eye. “Today, gang, is when we finally put the twist of the arcanum on those five principles.”

An excited stir surged through the class, and August Feymar stepped up to the board. “Number one… if you could, Mistress Vasiljev?”

“Objective,” Irena said. “All operations, and certainly war in its totality, needs a defined, decisive, and attainable objective.”

“And would any of you ladies and gentlemen wish to venture a guess as to how objective is affected by our new assumption — that one, or possibly both, parties have access to at least one type of magic? How about you, Mister Song?”

“The objective itself might change… Say, instead of cutting off the enemy’s access to resources like food, we may want to cut off their access to a unit of healers. But the overarching principle remains the same — the need for a defined, decisive, and attainable objective, that is.”

Feymar gave Song Mingi a concise nod. “Good guess, Mister Song. That is correct; unexpectedly, our new assumption of magic wielders in war does not remove the need for a clear objective. Well then, number two, Mistress Vasiljev, if you please..?”

“Unity,” Irena said. “A duck without a head is just dinner.”

“Very good, Mistress Vasiljev.” The ghost of a smile haunted the August’s lips. “Unity of command. The straightest path to our objective goes through unity of effort, and unity of effort can only be born of unity of command. No news for you lot there. But could anyone tell me how our new assumption plays into the second principle of war? Mistress Hwang?”

“It does not,” Yeji replied. “Just like the first principle, unity of command is still a requisite, magic or no magic.”

“This is correct… to a certain extent.” Feymar took a step forth, approaching the students. “Does anybody remember, if you think back to the unit on unity we covered all those moons ago, what the possible threats to this principle could be?”

There was a tentative raising of hands, mostly confined to the front row.

“Mister Kang?”

“The most obvious one is noncompliance or dissent, but this, we set aside for the purposes of theory, as we concern ourselves now with the science of how to maneuver with units _under_ our control,” Yeosang said, his voice cool and collected as usual. “The biggest threat we have to deal with is disturbances in our communication lines. Be it due to mechanical factors, or intrusion by the enemy.”

“Very good. It is also a rather nice segue to our next point… Which is what, Mistress Vasiljev?”

“Security,” Irena replied. “Never permit the enemy to acquire an unexpected advantage.”

The August turned back to Yeosang. “Now then, Mr. Kang, can you tell me what happens now?”

“Well… It gets a little tricky, doesn’t it? You can try to secure your communication lines by a number of means, but if the commander, and indeed, the enemy, can speak directly to your mind… well.”

“Excellent point,” August Feymar said, pointing proudly at Yeosang. “A duck without a head is just dinner… But cut the head off, replace it with a self-destructive one without the limbs realizing, and you get yourself… an abomination. Or something. I’ve taught this class for a decade now, and this is the one saying I can’t quite figure out, admittedly. But I digress. The point stands that Mindwalkers complicate the principle of security on the battlefield. And if you hadn’t given it any thought up until this point, now you have.”

Kang Yeosang reclined in his seat ever so slightly, which was as close to standing on the roof of the Main Building and announcing to the whole school that he was proud of himself as Kang Yeosang would do.

“Now, let me take this opportunity to step on the toes of August Roidac a little bit — the insufferable cockweasel believes he can monopolize the most intriguing topic of all and strut about like the cockweasel that he is. And if you have the urge to go tell the man himself what I just said, I beg of you to be my guest. I try a new one every year, and in the ten years that I have taught this class, I have not managed to coax a single word of vexation out of him,” Feymar said, taking his time crossing to the other end of the dais. “He probably did his little cockweasel strut, like this, and turned to you with his signature frown, and said ‘The simple matters of the battlefield might distract you in their garishness. Bloodmages brandishing their glittering weapons, Beastmakers summoning their mighty minions, Riftcallerss tearing and stitching the fabric of space itself. And the Mindwalkers might whisper into your ear false orders from your commander, and don’t misunderstand, that is scary. But take a moment to remove yourself from the field, and even the ‘operations’ in the words ‘Operations Practical.’ Imagine yourself, sitting in the peace of your own room with all manner of wards placed against harm. How do you know anything you say, anything you do, comes from _you_, and not some Mindwalker who has mastered their craft? Which one of you can say you are confident enough in your own sanity, your own… selfness… to know for sure?’”

Roidac paused, cherishing the quiet of a hundred bated breaths, as though time itself had halted with him. “Think about that.”
