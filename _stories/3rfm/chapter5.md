Irena’s heels clicked on the marble floor as she dashed through the vaulted halls. It was evening, for once, as she wove her way through the corridors of the Main Building; running, for once, not due to tardiness but for the cold winter air dancing on her arms that the airy silk on her skin did little to keep off. The dark that usually took these halls by night was in recluse tonight, repelled by the myriad lights marking the path to the ballroom. The stream of students in their finest regalia flowed in only one direction.

Getting ready had taken her longer than she had anticipated, but the opening ceremony would not commence for another half bell. Tomorrow, the sun would rise once more and bathe the peaks of Terreter in its cold light; the morning would see the knives whet and the lies told yet. But tonight, the Aetherial Quill’s reign prevailed still; and for as long as it did, Irena would stow away the Trials in the darkest corner of her mind, forget about the magic in her, and focus only on the magic in the air.

And magic in the air, there was plenty.

Irena slowed as she rounded the corner, the thrown-open doors of the ballroom coming into sight. Golden light and silvery music spilled out, inviting, enchanting. She dropped her gathered skirts and ran a smoothing hand over them before striding with assured steps to the other end of the hall.

The ball swallowed her at once as she stepped through the doors. Beneath the high dome of the colossal room, grand staircases fell away to the main floor. Balconies and boxes ringed the space, overlooking the empty dance floor and the entrance, where the milling early crowd was exchanging pleasantries. A million star lanterns burst from the hanging chandelier, drooped from every jutting structure, dangled from the wall sconces on their gold chains. The gold rimming the glass reflected the light from its siblings, strewing stardust everywhere.

Slowly, carefully, Irena descended the stairs, cherishing every step. She donned her most aloof smile, slipping into the slippers of a storybook princess. And if the entire crowd did not turn to gape at her, she was not going to let that touch her fantasy for once.

The bottom of the steps came sooner than she wished. First-years overwhelmed the crowd — not necessarily surprising, as there were as many of them as the rest of the students combined, which was an incredible advantage when it came to the matter of dominating a crowd. They darted to and fro with an enthusiasm peculiar to those unmarred by the influence of the Terreter, blades yet unwhet by the callous ways of the Academy, all coupled up for their first ball.

There were older faces, too — nobles and functionaries peppered into the crowd, here to scout and thus engaged in conversations with the older students. They were the employers, the scythes that got to reap the crops cultivated by the Academy. In just two years, Irena would be one of the few lobbying students, eager to improve upon their prospects — if she were to survive the coming storm, that was. For now, though, Irena wove through the crowd, searching for familiar faces.

Powdered gold and silver glimmered from eyelids, shoulders, arms. Silk and chiffon glittered under the constellation of star-lights. Perfume and cologne filled the scant spaces between the guests, melding into a potpourri of flowers and spices, amber and sweet fruit.

And in that mix, a plethora of familiar faces with a distinct lack of friendly ones. The buzzing of thoughts intertwined with the murmur of polite conversation thrummed in her skull, a headache threatening. Irena emerged out of the other end, her eyes combing the scene for a backup plan.

The tables. The opening ceremony would begin soon, and already the large mahogany tables arrayed along the two opposite walls of the ballroom were filling up, figures roaming to find their assigned seats.

By the time Irena found her table it was already occupied. Mark Lee sat alone with a pleasant smile plastered on his face, his long hair swept back, his tux perfectly fitted. Donning her most agreeable smile she glided over to him with all the grace she could muster. She could feel the constant current of his thoughts, an odd yet welcome change to the usual dead silence of the capable, or the erratic onslaught of jumbled knots common to first years who had not yet learned to shield their minds. His was a calm, contented sort of hum, a gentle lapping against the shores of Irena’s mind.

“Ah, there you are.” Mark’s chocolate brown eyes landed on her as she approached.

“Oh, hi Mark,” Irena said, raising a brow. “You sound expectant.”

Mark Lee pointed at the nameplate placed neatly on the table as she seated herself beside him. “Well, I did expect you to come to your seat at some point, yes.”

“Not in the mood for idle chitchat?” she asked with a tilt of her head toward the crowd.

“There will be plenty of time for idle chit-chat. Thought I’d find my spot before it gets too hectic here.”

_Or were you fleeing the orgy of thoughts, as I was?_

It was an affliction shared by Mindwalkers, especially those with keener senses — the easier it was to reach out and grasp those threads, the harder it was to shut off. One could learn not to make noise — indeed it was one of the first things taught to the pupils upon their arrival at the Academy — but one could not unhear. “Fair. I haven’t found any of my friends yet, so…”

“You’ve found me,” he said, his smile breaking into a grin. “But you wound me, Irena. Do I not count?”

“But of course you do. I meant back there, clearly.”

“Ah, what sweet relief. You look great, by the way.”

“Thank you. You too, love the tux.”

“Thanks. Are you here alone?”

Thoughts of Ryujin threatened, a battering ram against the fortress of her mind. Irena nodded. “You?”

“Me too; it seemed too big a hassle.”

“A hassle? For you?” Irena scoffed. “Please. You could sneeze and a dozen students would materialize before you could blink to hand you a tissue.”

“Oh, stop,” Mark said, blood rushing to his cheeks. “That’s ridiculous.”

“You want to bet?”

“I would, actually. Loser does the next Theory of Magic assignment?”

“I will take those chances, Mark Lee,” Irena said. “Next week? We can schedule a sneeze, anywhere on campus with enough people within earshot, your choice.”

“Absolutely,” said Mark.

The eighth evening bell struck short after with the grave import of emperors. The rich toll fell across the room in a cascade, anticipation mounting with each echo. The peal’s victory was absolute against the excited murmurs puncturing the stupor of wonder melding with the panic of those who had lingered too long to find their seats. Darkness enveloped the two-thousand-odd guests, solidifying its reign as the lamps winked out in a sweep.

Irena felt her breath hitch in marvel despite herself. For a moment after the bell’s last echo made its grand exit, the darkness remained, now left hollow. Then, the music began. The lights followed after. One by one in temporal disarray, the thousands of lamps drooping from the vaulted dome fizzled to life, each bursting in a shower of gold. Stardust rained down on them to bedeck the hall in glamor it had not lacked to start with.

The orchestra quieted as the star lanterns dimmed. The large box across the tables lit up to reveal the Augusts in their ceremonial capes, arrayed beside the Rostrum of the Prime August. The Prime August herself stood haloed by Wisdom, the constellation glimmering behind her.

“Good evening!” her voice boomed to fill the void that the bells had left behind, enhanced by the invisible gates that conducted only sound placed all around the room. Hers was a voice of command without oppression, power without force. In the pause that ensued were no murmurs; even the threads of thought emanating from the guests had honed to the sharp and steady violin string of keen attention. “Esteemed students, distinguished Augusts, honorable guests. The Academy welcomes you. Tonight, we celebrate excellence.”

All about her, Irena felt thoughts buzzing in response.

“Built on the cliffs of Terreter to guard the world against the threat of the Arcane Plague, the Academy has become more than a first and last defense against the threat of Chaos’s corrupt forces, a fortress standing steadfast in the way of total ruin. Today, the Academy is an institution synonymous with prowess and eminence, cultivating the greatest minds and magic wielders of all time. In other words, the world’s most prized employees.”

Laughter bubbled from the crowd as Prime August Tiercelin paused for effect.

“Students. The classes sharpen your mind, enhance your physical abilities, and endow you with indispensable skills and valuable knowledge you will use for the rest of your life. The Trials whet you into the blades that you are. And the connections you make here, friend and foe, will stay with you for a lifetime.”

There were other notes to the chorus of the crowd now. tension, thrill, and anticipation harmonized with attention.

“Dear guests. We are honored to host you here at the zenith of Terreter for this grand occasion. On behalf of the Academy, I would like to extend our gratitude for your presence. Tonight, you have the chance to get to know our current crop of pupils, the most promising wielders in all eight continents of Halora. You will forgive the complications associated with the journey, I trust. The very foundational mission of the Academy necessitates secrecy, and thus I thank you for gracing us with your presence nevertheless.”

Irena heard the nearby attendants’ minds spike with varying levels of discomfort.

The Academy’s location was not known to anybody but the Augusts, to shield it, and with it the Arcane plague, from any outside influence. Thus, Terreter remained a myth, a place only defined by the institution built atop it and the contained bubble where once Chaos had sunk its claws into Halora.

Irena fought to ground her wandering mind. Thinking about the Night Market with the entire school in the same room was a recipe for disaster.

“Students, especially seniors, I advise you to use this opportunity to meet your future employers.”

_And enemies,_ Irena thought.

“Now, as Prime August, in the name of all the Augusts of the Academy, I would like to officially commence the ball,” she said, eyeing the crowd with a beaming grin as she spread her arms. “It’s party time!”

Music crescendoed to life once again as applause erupted. The lanterns sparkled back to bright luminescence, and motion engulfed the ballroom that had been utterly quiet and restrained moments ago.

Mark caught Irena’s eye as they both got up, his smile sweet. “A drink and a dance, Irena?”

Irena paused, hesitating. Prolonged proximity to and contact with a suspected Mindwalker coupled with alcohol — an outrageously terrible idea; but then, her strategy in the Quasar Trials could not depend upon absolute solitude. Appealing to the sense of amity would largely work in Irena’s favor, and a rejection of Mark’s offer would constitute a confession of weakness. Besides, tonight was about appearances more than any other, and a suggested closeness with someone like Mark Lee might even afford her some protection.

“That depends,” Irena said with a playful twist to her smile. “Can you keep up?”

Mark Lee grinned. “You want to bet?”

“I’ll take that action,” said Irena. “But first, let’s see about that drink.”

Half a bell later they stood by the dance floor, fuzz from the punch already sprouting in Irena’s mind. Conversation layered with the jumble of thoughts buzzed in her mind, dizzying. Already the dancing had begun, silk and chiffon swooshing in concord. First-year students still swathed in their naivete and overwhelm waltzed alongside functionaries observing rules of decorum. Some notable couples, too, dotted the spectacle. The Brethren's own Taehyung had ceremoniously taken to the floor with Jenny, a symbolic fulfillment of their duty as the faces of the two most prominent forces to ever grace the school — their respective alliances of the Brethren and the Plague, a year their junior. August Roidac and August Vefort were a force of their own as they whirled about, moving with the grace and agility befitting of their title.

“Do you see any of our friends?” Mark asked as they edged along the floor.

Our _friends,_ Irena noted. _Who are you talking about? Are you being nice, or is this your strategy, Mark Lee?_

_Stop being paranoid,_ another voice in her mind countered. _It is throwing off your thoughts._ Yet the recollection of last year’s ball — of her partner, in particular — remained a small knot within.

“Not that I can see,” she said. “Shall we dance? Or are you trying to chicken out of Magic Theory?”

“Am I indeed,” Mark laughed, raising his brows. “But you wound my honor so, Irena. Would I ever — dance, we shall, and now.”

Irena let a giggle bubble out of her as Mark took the hand she offered and pulled her along, slipping into the dance with perfect precision and prowess. He spun her around, and she laughed again, a light ease spreading through her. For a little while she surrendered to the maelstrom, letting the glitter of pearls and diamonds and the glimmer of stardust and gold streak across her vision as she traced the well-practiced steps of the waltz. Her dragonfly wing skirts brushed against her bare legs, impossibly soft. And for a moment the Academy disappeared from her world, the Quasar Trials waved away to naught. For the blink of an eye, she was an incorporeal gown whirling under a gemstone sky never touched by the sun, fated to dance until the end of time and then thereafter.

Irena blinked, almost losing her footing as she felt the solid marble floor of the Academy’s ballroom beneath the soles of her slippers. Her breath caught as she caught herself, and she stared at the young man she was sharing the dance with, his bearing as agreeable as ever, and very much _real_.

“My, my,” she said, harnessing as much aloofness and control as she could. “Yeonjun and Winter are dancing.”

“Are they?”

In his manner was a total opaqueness, a perfect equity that bothered Irena. Did he know something? Anything? Nothing? Was there anything to know?

She tried to suppress the discomfort, hoping it would pass off as little but an offhand remark.

“Augusts Vefort and Roidac are finished with their waltz, it seems,” Mark said, matching her tone. “August Feymar has the opportunity to do the funniest thing.”

“Which is?”

“Ask August Vefort to dance, of course. And knowing him, I bet he will. Just watch.”

Irena caught a glance over his shoulder as they turned. “Do you think they are staging the rivalry for the fun of it? Or do you think there is some truth to the disdain there?”

A soberness took over his mien as he leaned in toward her. “Can I trust you?”

Irena’s brows rose at that, her senses sharpening.

“I have a conspiracy that they are secretly together,” Mark said.

Irena smiled. “Do you want to bet on that, or have you had enough of my bets?”

“Enough of your bets?” Mark said. “I wasn’t aware that there was such a thing.”

“Unfortunately it is a not-entirely-verifiable, and even less unverifiable a claim. And that would put me at a disadvantage.”

“That’s correct, I’m afraid. Ah well. I’m sure another bet will present itself before long, do not worry.”

“Would I ever.”

“I have to admit, I am a little intimidated,” Mark said, his tone casual, as he met her gaze. “I’m not saying that I underestimated your skill…”

“…But you underestimated my skill,” Irena said with another smile.

“Well, I hope you take it as a compliment when I say I didn’t expect this. Where did you learn to dance?”

“Here, of course; where else?”

“You are not some princess from a small kingdom, then?”

_He’s trying to glean information about my past,_ Irena thought, the thought unpleasantly sobering. _I suppose I should thank you, Istikbal, for my inability to betray information._

“Did you expect me to be?”

“Of course,” Mark said. “How else does one explain the regal air about you?”

“You are so full of bullwad,” said Irena with a grin.

Mark Lee chuckled. “It is just that you are better than a lot of us, who also learned here, it seems. That is all my meaning.”

The implication hung between them, too obvious for Irena to ignore. The Bladesingers’ gift of strength, agility, and muscle memory far stronger than that of the average person transcended just their ability to fight well. In the matter of ballroom graces, too, did they display an edge.

It was easier to don aloofness when the accusations were wrong, luckily. “Thank you.”

“Have you heard about the first year who declared himself today?” Mark carried on with the same indifference and opaqueness to his intentions, as though every word carried no more weight than any polite discussion.

“Ah, but how could I not?” Irena said. “A Jungkook or an idiot? _There_ is a bet for you.”

“That’s a silly bet. No one is a Jungkook. Just yet another ego-pumped asshole underestimating the Trials and overestimating their own abilities.”  
“Speaking of…” Irena looked around, trying to spot the golden child of the Academy. The young face of the Brethren, the greatest alliance to step foot in the school, whispers of whose legend echoed through the halls long before they ever emerged victorious in the Quasar Trials and would echo long after they left — not only was Jungkook _part_ of such a formidable force, he was the one to inspire most awe and admiration, only a first-year when he rose to the top of both his class and the year above’s. The Valedictorian. A legendary Bladesinger and an astute scholar, as well as a social prodigy comparable to skilled Mindwalkers. A triple threat. “I’m not sure where he is, but the rest of the Brothers are being worshipped by the Malyrian grand vizier.”

“By the end of the night, these functionaries will be at one another’s throats, trying to snag another minute with them. Makes me wonder what diplomatic constellation they’ll find themselves in. Alliances don’t tend to outlive graduation for long — but then, there was never an alliance this successful. And then the Black Plague, right after them. I wonder if it will be a consideration in their choices of office… Ah, and there are the Hwang siblings. Shall we go to them?”

Irena followed Mark Lee’s gaze to see Hyunjin and Yeji skirting the dance floor, bestowing their charming smiles on anybody with enough acquaintance or courage to talk to them.

“Greetings, friends,” Mark said as they approached, his smile as radiant as the ones returned by the siblings. “Look whom I had the luck of sharing a table with.”

“But Irena, aren’t you looking magnificent,” Hyunjin said as he took her hand, giving her a little spin. Irena grinned at him, indulging. “Where did you find this? We must get Yeji’s gown from this dressmaker next year.”

“That, is a secret I cannot divulge, Hyunjin; for your sister is already far too lovely. Put her in a dress like this, and we might break the universe.”

_Besides, if I told you, she would get me expelled before I could blink._

“Oh, stop,” Yeji said, draped in all manner of humility. “That is simply silly. I wouldn’t look as ethereal as you do if you put in me in a gown cut from the stars themselves.”

“I mean it from the bottom of my heart,” Irena said. “By the way, Where are Soobin and Seonghwa?”

“Getting drinks,” Hyunjin said. “Oh, and, excuse us, Mark Lee, for our rudeness. Pleasure seeing you too; the lady here was too enchanting, however.”

“No offense taken,” said Mark with a chuckle. “I have a pair of eyes of my own, you know. I didn’t think for a second that I could be perceived next to Irena.”

“That must be why you came unaccompanied,” Yeji said, turning to Irena. “Anybody who asked you here tonight would doom themselves to complete invisibility for the rest of the night.”

Irena didn’t react to the subtle spite in her words, donning instead her most bashful modesty. “Your flattery is much unwarranted.”

A new waltz rose from the band, spurring change in the dancing crowd. New couples joined the old, and partners were exchanged to stave off any suspicion that a dance might be more than a dance. Irena became too aware of the glances directed their way. Hwang Hyunjin, dashing in his slick black tux, his blond hair pulled back, seemed to singlehandedly steal all the attention, even from someone like Mark Lee. Aloofness plastered on his handsome face he turned to his sister, a smile tugging on his lips. “Would you honor me with a dance, lovely lady?”

“I suppose I shall,” Yeji replied with a playful indulgence. As the siblings pulled away, a gleaming tour de force of their parents’ genetics, Irena could see the shimmering halo of gloating around Yeji. Exclusivity emanated from her mind in the brassy notes of a trumpet, turning the air heavy with incense. Mark’s face remained pleasantly indifferent. _How can you not smell that?_ she wondered as she fought to keep her own a mask of ignorance with only some success.

She had readied herself for another dance spent in the company of Mark Lee when the swirling sea of people revealed a surprise. Kim Doyoung materialized before them, a toothy grin resplendent on his features. Rings glittered on every finger; his honey-sweet cologne almost preceded him.

“Irena?” His voice was velvet as he bowed, extending a hand toward her.

“Oh my, but how could I refuse?” She beamed at him as she took his hand. As Kim Doyoung’s arm linked with hers, she shot Mark Lee a look over her shoulder, who responded to her apologetic shrug with an amused wink before striding away smoothly toward waving classmates.

Doyoung’s heels clicked as they made their way over to a free spot among the crowd. With more flourish than necessary, he assumed his starting pose, and Irena sent a quick prayer to Istikbal her deep curtsy did not seem mockingly pointed, her smile half-hidden by her tucked chin.

As the music swelled once more to sheathe whispers of romance and conspiracy alike in its lilting tinkle, he led her through the steps, his movements sharp. “Let’s talk game.”

“Can it not wait until tomorrow?” Irena said through her dizzy stupor, his overpowering cologne adding to the champagne and the twirling, misting her mind. “I’m on a no-business policy tonight.”

“Let’s make a deal, then. Indulge me but for a dance, and one dance only,” Doyoung said. “I promise you want to hear this.”

Irena sighed her concession. “Very well.”

“I have information for you,” he said. “I will tell you right now if you wish, and all I ask for in return is that you issue a challenge when I ask for it.”

It was instinct that suppressed the annoyance and let through the amusement, carefully sifting through the bubbling emotion cocktail. The chuckle that escaped her carried disbelief.

“Trust me, it is in both of our interests,” he continued. “Or I would not have asked. I try to avoid getting on people’s bad side when I can. It is an unpleasant affair.”

“Is that so?” Irena asked, her tone flat.

“Truly.” Doyoung sighed. “Besides, partnership feels so much more… fulfilling, you know?”

She remained quiet, trying to untangle all of it, her thoughts clouded by the scent of overripe plum and sweet tobacco. _A deal with Doyoung. A warning in exchange for a challenge — unless I break my promise._

“I can explain in due time,” he said evenly. “For now, your relationship with this person cannot be affected.”

_My relationship with this person…_ So it was somebody she knew. _Is this a ploy? Surely there is no way he thinks I will accept these terms. Is he sowing doubt in my mind?_ All it took was the vague promise of information, and Irena would be left wondering which friendly face was about to look her in the eye as they stabbed her in the back, completely isolated.

“As I said, it is in both of our interests,” Doyoung pressed.

_He is insistent,_ Irena observed. _Is he desperate? I could_ _use that, maybe._ “And what if I don’t keep my promise?”

“That’s your prerogative, I suppose.”

The uncertainties associated with the deal nagged at her. _A promise is but a breath of air on the breeze,_ August Roidac’s voice echoed in her mind. _And trust is but a knife in your throat._

If only she could talk to Istikbal… She could surmise the intent behind Doyoung’s words — or perhaps even circumvent the need for him, if the goddess could directly glimpse at his hand and lay them out for her, as she used to. _What are you after, Istikbal..?_ “You must think me mad to even offer such a thing. A challenge for a half-truth?”

“A _half_\-truth?”

“_Lies and half-truths, the only currency one can deal in,_” Irena quoted, almost surprised that the words rode her voice and not Roidac’s.

“Let me sweeten the deal for you, then,” Doyoung said with a smile that told her he was in on the joke, the only sort of smile Doyoung seemed capable of. “And what could be sweeter than love?”

“You’re not about to offer to prostitute yourself, are you?” Irena said. “I mean, I’m flattered, but you should really ask someone else.”

“You are funny, Irena, which is why I like you. And I do like you, which is why I’m here.”

“What, dancing with me? Yes, I had supposed that might have something to do with it.” She exhaled slowly, the quickening pace of the dance beginning to tire her out. “What about love, then?”  
“A little sparrow chirruped in my ear a cute little story about a couple who have been sneaking away during small hours of the day to relish the sweet, intoxicating honey of each other’s taste.”

“You should get help.”

He let out a laugh, perfectly in cadence with the rhythm of the waltz. “They were very careful indeed, to shield their perfect new lovers’ rose-tinted world from the unforgiving teeth and claws of the Academy.” A dramatic sigh interjected his words. “Alas, the stones have ears, my dear.”

“So you want me to agree blindly to issue a challenge to a mysterious figure in exchange for gossip.”

“I want you to _promise_ me to issue a challenge to somebody, whom it would be in your interest to challenge, in exchange for not one, but _two_ highly valuable pieces of information.”

“If you are so sure it would be in my interest to challenge this person, why do you need my promise, for which you are offering not one, but _two_ highly valuable pieces of information?”

“Ah… You got me, Irena. The secret is out… Well, it is true — I _am_ a magnanimous god.”

“Right.”

“I suppose it’s my fondness. The information that I initially offered, is a warning. And the second — well, let’s not fool ourselves. Gossip _is_ fun. It is the primary humane instinct, you know.” Doyoung sighed a more genuine sigh than his usual kind. “Besides, I should contribute to the economy.”

As the violin trilled a last note announcing the end of the dance, he guided her through a spin; and she spun, the world blurring in a streak of glitz and color, his support providing a precisely perfect amount of force and momentum. Wonted applause rose from the encircling onlookers, mingling already underway in preparation for the next dance.

“Ah, alas, I keep my promises; I am expressly forbidden from saying another word, I believe.” Doyoung bowed with much pomp and pride. “A pleasure, as always, my dear. Think on my proposal.”

With that, he walked away, blending into the churning crowd.

_Now, what the hell was that?_ The cacophony of thought threads battered against the gates of Irena’s mind. She wove through the press of people toward the edge, her nose accosted by perfume and sweat, the air suddenly cool on her skin despite the heat of the crowd. She shivered, feeling pain slowly blossoming through her soles. _The first is a warning…_

She caught Yuna’s face among the guests by the edge of the dance floor, draped in a hot pink gown reminiscent of rose petals, her gaze itinerant, distracted from a chatting Chaeryong and Lia beside her. Irena couldn’t help but smile at the dreamy glow haloing her friend, starry-eyed and beatific at once as she made her way over.

“Looking for somebody?”

With a small jump of startlement, Yuna turned to Irena, a grin spreading on her alluring face. “Irena! By the gods, you look gorgeous!”

“If it isn’t the queen praising the handmaiden,” Irena said. “Found any emperors to bring to their knees yet?”

“No, just the Morcad shah,” Yuna said. Irony was absent from her tone, innocent matter-of-factness in its stead. “Have you danced with anyone?”

“With Mark Lee and Kim Doyoung.”

“Oh?” Lia cut in, her conversation with Chaeryoung dropped as Irena felt the sharp points of attention hone in on her. “You are friends with Mark Lee? I did not know.”

“We’re not unfamiliar.” The strange buzzing emanating from Lia filled Irena’s mind as her instincts whirred, ever looking for threads, seldom finding them. _What is that? Jealousy? Animosity? What is that discordant note underlying the bright orange peal of friendly interest?_

“You must be a decent dancer if you could keep up with those two,” Chaeryong said.

Irena waved away the compliment with a casual hand. “I hardly had to do anything, to be fair — they did most of the work.”

“You’re here alone, right?” Lia asked.

“I haven’t accepted any proposals this year.”

_Not that there were any._

“It’s the smart thing to do,” Lia said. “First years are always too eager to couple up for this, but I guess I don’t need to tell _you_ how badly things can go…”

Irena could feel the mounting tension behind her eyes, an intangible, taut string pulling on her as her mind raced for a response.

_Subtlety isn’t exactly her strongsuit, is it? Somebody was going to bring up Ryujin sooner or later. Just brush it off._ “What can I say? I was hardly the only one she fooled. At least I managed to keep my head.” _Figuratively, of course._ The Academy didn’t kill the failed fledglings — no, that would be inhumane. They simply stripped them of everything they had ever known — their magic, their memories, their very sense of self.

Chaeryong’s voice lilted into the silence. “Speak of the devil…”

Irena froze. A hundred shards of ice stabbed at her all at once, her limbs growing leaden.

And then, the devil in question spoke. “Good evening, ladies.”  
Irena all but felt the fires of all encircling her, the world suddenly burning up as Shin Ryujin’s face came into view, the curves of her figure wrapped in fine gold. And girdling her waist, a most ironic belt that as good as served as a name tag — a golden boa snake.

“This brings back memories, doesn’t it, Irena?”

Irena felt all breath sucked out of her lungs, her stomach in revolt as Ryujin moved closer. _Ryujin. Shin Ryujin._

She came to a halt a mere foot before her, too close, far too close, all sound but her bright, honeyed rasp submerged in water. “We should dance, for old times’ sake.”

Fury lashed at Irena’s heart. _For old times’ sake… You betrayed me, ruined my reputability, almost got me expelled. If I say yes, I am a spineless coward who lets people trample over me. If I say no, I am an emotionally sensitive weakling who holds grudges over strategic losses._ She cocked a single brow. “Missed me?”

“Of course.” Ryujin’s gaze slid down to Irena’s lips. “What’s not to miss?”

Irena scoffed, her heartbeat almost deafening. “I like your belt, Ryujin.”

Ryujin’s lips pulled back to reveal a grin. “I thought you might. Now, how about that dance?”  
“We shall see,” Irena said. “If you’ll excuse me, I’ll have to go relieve myself first. I may have had a tad too much champagne.”

<center>*</center>


A quarter of a bell later, Irena stood by the band, hands gripping her skirt as her eyes roved over the room. The last hour of the ball had brought the festivities into full swing, elevating the band and the dancing crowd to perfect accord. The restrained buzz of small talk had been replaced by bubbling laughter by now, nudged on by the silver trays heaped with champagne weaving in and out, glitz and glamor already beginning to wash off the guests in varying amounts, capes loosened, chairs filling up to rest feet sore from heels.

_Let’s hope she doesn’t find me before I find company,_ she thought with a small prayer to Istikbal.

And the goddess was generous this day — there, by the window side of the room, stood Soobin and Seonghwa, chatting with a third-year she did not know by name.

Ducking through the press of people, she made her way over, cool relief washing over her. She had almost made it to her waving friends when a flash of gold emerged from the nearby group of people, the likeness of a boa snake caught in the light from the star lanterns. And she was heading straight toward her, a determined smile defining her expression.

Irena cursed. She glanced about, feigning all manner of unawareness. _I can lose her in the crowd, if I can find a group dense enough._ And yet this side of the ballroom remained sparser than the rest, with little to hide behind. A circle of dignitaries had taken up residence near the arched windows, their bejeweled facades bathed in the light of the night sky. It was the only gathering of people big enough to conceal her, but she couldn’t join them, nor did she have an exit — except _the balconies_. That would do.

She slipped behind a cluster of moving guests, excusing herself with a hushed reticence as she blended into the dignitaries. The motions of the crowd threatened to overwhelm her, her vision beginning to swim. _Perhaps fresh air isn’t such a bad idea, after all._ She sidled along the curtain and threw herself out into the night.
