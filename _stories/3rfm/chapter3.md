Irena’s breath rose in white clouds, the dry earth hard beneath her soles. The quiet Unity Day morning carried no warmth as she stepped outside, and the overcast sky softened the shadows in the near-empty courtyard. The cold struck Irena like a gentle slap, easing the headache.

It had been a good morning on that front. The headache was present, as always, but not debilitating enough to render her bedridden. The remnants of the dream stowed away in the attic of her mind, she wended her way to the Atheneum. Focusing on the wintry bite of the air, the birdsong that filled the silence, she honed in on the buzzing all about her, muted, tranquil. Individual threads of thought whispered into her mind from the nearby students, too faint to untangle. Of course. Dotting the yard were mostly upperclassmen with enough mental defenses in place.

She entered the Atheneum, removing her cloak preemptively before the wave of heat could crash into and overwhelm her. Here, too, was the Unity Day quiet present. A few overachievers speckled the atrium, absorbed gazes behind gilt glasses poring over tomes and parchments, quills scratching zealously. Rapt minds were easier to penetrate, but Irena ignored the droning hum, feeling her headache sharpen as the winter chill thawed around it. A Mindwalker could slither into one’s mind and numb the pain, squash it underfoot like unwanted weeds even if they could not uproot them. They could be strong enough to reach out and grasp the most hidden desires, the most carefully veiled of secrets, and pluck them like a ruby leaf from an ash tree in autumn. They could crack a person’s psyche open, and even completely unravel it, pulling on a single loose thread to watch all the others come apart. And yet, their own would remain untouchable. Ever near, ever bare, ever impossibly beyond reach.

“Irena!”

Irena stopped short before the archway to the left wing, wheeling on her heels to spot a familiar face jogging toward her.

“Irena, hey,” Jungwon said, tousled hair framing his feline eyes.

Irena smiled. “Hey, kid. You’re up early.”

“Yeah, well…” He shrugged. “I won’t pass the Trials by dreaming.”

_You have no idea,_ Irena thought. “That’s the spirit. What are you working on?”

“Right now? I’m just revising some stuff from magic theory.”

“Riveting.”

Jungwon chuckled. “Not a fan, huh? It’s not so bad.”

“It’s better than knives being hurled at you on day two of the Academy, I’ll give you that.”

“I thought I was crazy for not having enjoyed that,” Jungwon said. “Everyone else certainly made it seem so.”

“Word of advice? Listen to everything and heed none of it. Your classmates are full of bullwad.”

“Heh, thanks. You’ve given me more useful information in our two conversations than I ever learned in six weeks of Magic Theory.”

“That’ll happen.”

“Where are you headed? The Forge?”

“Oh, uh, yeah, I just need to pick up some materials… But I’ll see you at the House, maybe?”

Jungwon smiled, dimples showing. “Yeah, for sure. See you later.”

“Later, kiddo,” she said before disappearing with quick steps down into the Forge, the heat growing pressing, and then into the tunnels where a damp chill greeted her.

A half-hour later she stood before the shimmering curtain that separated The Night Market from the town of Fyeth Dorei. Beyond the pall, the deserted market shifted with a strange sense of motion, the silence that surrounded the place a mock, deceitful silence. It bubbled with unheard commotion lurking beneath the surface, enticing, promising. Irena closed her eyes, soaking in the lie. She readied herself for the onslaught of sound and motion. Then, with bated breath, she stepped through the boundary.

It fell against her all at once, without crescendo, without ease. The Night Market bloomed to life in all its vibrancy. Out of thin air materialized throngs of milling creatures, whispered into existence. The crowd moved, a force of chaos in and of itself. Merchants and shoppers with gemstone skin and onyx eyes haggled loudly, the perusing mob shuffling through the streets, silver and bronze horns protruding. They glittered in the misty illumination of the bubble, shouting and scurrying. Irena smiled and let herself be claimed by the current.

The market existed in its own closed bubble, a chrysalis of chaos. It was a tangle of passages connected to each other in ways that should not be possible. Stairways leading to levels that should have been below when climbed; streets that bridged squares on the opposite side of the market; the perpetual night sky impossibly canopying every layer.

And, the Lost – the creatures of the market, who roamed this pocket dimension, unified by a single quality. The Mark of the Arcane Plague, which could only be gained by trading something away. Something precious. Hence, the _Lost_. Or so they said.

It did not manifest itself physically; instead, the ability to enter the market – the permission – was the sole face of the mark. And that just as well, for bearing the mark was grounds for instant expulsion from the Academy. How exactly this was enforced, Irena did not know, and indeed, she had yet to be caught.

Irena followed the Street With The Red House, took the right path where it forked, and climbed the stairs at the end of the Short Road, emerging into the Street With Two Streetlamps. The crowd thinned a bit here, giving way to ambling patrons peering into the vibrant store windows. Their clothing varied, ranging from long overcoats with fur trimmings to the thinnest scraps of gauze providing bare coverage. The snug coat around Irena's shoulders blended in perfectly, attracting no notice. She passed the first streetlamp and stopped before a two-story building, its bright yellow façade covered with antlers. There was no store window, only a small, black door carved from obsidian. The bell above the door chimed as Irena entered, closing it behind herself.

Bogena's shop was a hollowed-out fairy chimney boxed in by an artificial façade; as it was, the interior was lit by a forest of hanging lamps, drooping to various heights and shedding light in various hues. Neatly stacked shelves surrounded the room with an army of dress forms garbed in unfinished garments taking up center space, and a set of rickety stairs descended into the atelier where Bogena worked her magic.

The shopkeep's head reared out of the stairwell, her fiddlehead fern hair bound into an elaborate knot, colorful lights shifting on her rose quartz skin as she crested the steps. Her dress flowed like rippling water as she moved, delicate and mesmerizing though the cut was simple.

"Hello," Irena said, voice coming out more muted than she'd intended. "I need a gown."

"Come in," Bogena said with a smile. "Have you been doing well?"

"Yes, thank you. And yourself?"

"Same old, same old. Have you been liking your new shirt?"

"I haven't had the chance to wear it yet."

"Tell me if the sleeves are comfortable. If not, bring it here and I will fix them for you." Bogena moved to stand in front of Irena, looking her up and down with her hands on her hips. "A gown, you say? What is the occasion?"

"A dance," Irena said. "I also need shoes, if you know where to get them."

Bogena nodded, then paused, cocking an eyebrow at her. "This will likely cost you even more than what you got for the hand mirror."

Irena carefully reached into her inner cloak pocket and removed a pair of scissors, holding it out for Bogena's examination. It was a small thing of little value, a stock iron pair commonly found in any haberdashery; yet the dressmaker snatched it out of her palm, lifting it to light eagerly. Her hand was slightly cool to the touch, and smooth like polished stone. "That will do. Let us get to work, then." She zipped from shelf to shelf, pulling down bolts of cloth with prompt exactitude. Her seemingly slender arms did not quiver for a moment under the weight of the fabrics. With a single glance at the younger woman, she drifted to the stairs, and Irena stirred to follow in her wake.

The atelier downstairs was slightly better illumined, with two bright lamps warring for dominance, one by the sewing machine, and the other by the raised dais. Irena took her place on the platform without prompting while Bogena laid out the fabrics on a nearby workstation.

"Did you have a particular color or cut in mind?"

Irena shrugged. "You're the costumier."

"Excellent," Bogena said, a grin flourishing on her mien. "Customers seldom know what they speak of. Now, then – let me take your cloak. And if you would…"

Irena felt no chill crawl up her arms as Bogena eased the cloak off her; nor did she shiver as she disrobed down to her undergarments. The dressmaker approached to roughly wrap an orange fabric about her form, a delicate material striped black with white spots. Great butterfly wings, Irena realized. But Bogena's arms dropped, the material brushing the floor as it fell. "No, the color drowns you out."

The next fabric unfurled to envelop her, scales shimmering iridescently as the stiff cloth clung onto her with the few pins holding ends together. Irena blinked at her reflection in the mirror, taking in the bulky form of the makeshift gown. "Bogena, I look like a knight heading into battle."

"And are you not?" Still, she sighed, removing the pins and rolling the fabric back into a bolt. "Fine. Perhaps no walantu scales for you."

The dressmaker's face was hopeful as she picked up the third. Mint green with an opalescent translucence to it, it made Irena wonder if she would need to bring in a second pair of scissors to afford. And as Bogena made quick work of the rough silhouette, she smiled despite herself at the softness of it, gentle and intimate like a cool lake on a sultry summer's day. Bogena stepped back, examining her work.

"Dragonfly. The shade is perfect. I can layer the top with mesh for an opaque gradient, and leave the legs as is. How are you feeling?"

Irena turned slightly, watching the light caper across the fabric in the mirror. "I like it."

The woman stared at her pensively for a second; then, with a spark careening through her obsidian eyes, she scuttled to a chest next to her workstation. "One moment."

The lace she produced rippled as she approached, woven from the finest threads Irena had ever seen, glistening like nothing else.

"Spider silk, embroidered with lunarglass beads. For the sleeves." She held it up to her arms, and the lace acquiesced to the green cast of the fabric, reflecting it back as though caught by its magic touch.

"It's beautiful."

"As for the cut, a fitted bodice with a sweetheart neckline and a simple full skirt, I think. The detail of the fabric would get swallowed with anything more elaborate."

Irena only nodded.

"I will get to work, then. Do you want to pay now or later?"

Irena reached for the pouch in her inner pocket, and shook it, making the gold coins jingle. "What I got last time for the mirror. And you can keep the scissors."

"Much obliged." Bogena smiled. "I will have it ready in three days, princess. And till then…"

Irena caught the single gold coin the dressmaker threw at her, hand stretching out in a reflex acquired during the First Trials.

"Keep it." Her smile widened into a grin, teeth flashing. "You might need it."

\*

Irena's name blinked starkly back at her in a mocking pulse. She exhaled, fighting to keep her mask in check, to ward off the flourishing frustration welling within from creeping into her face.

It was the morning of Serenity Day, one of the two days for the update on the preliminary rankings, which the confident would stand before the large wall of names to study, and the rest would try to catch a moment alone to read. The small hours had swept away any crowd that may have congregated here in the foyer, and for the moment, Irena found herself mostly alone in the large hall. An upperclassmen couple was nestled into an alcove, and a few overachieving early birds would make their way through occasionally. Barring that, there was no one around to witness Irena's reaction to the preliminary rankings. Something Irena was glad to observe, seeing as the situation hadn't exactly improved since last week's second update.

She could feel a headache coming on – or, rather, making a reprise – as she stared at the wall, her nails digging into her palms.

Three-hundred-twelfth. Sixty-two ranks below the cutoff.  Sixty-two people between her and non-expulsion was bad enough, and likely it included not a few "lurkers" – those who kept their preliminary rankings low on purpose to secure easy duels early on. By the time the rest of the class got wiser to it, they would have already gathered enough points to sit back and look pretty for the rest of the year without big trouble.

Not Irena, though. No. Irena had earned her spot by virtue of folly and incompetence.

So close to the start of the real trials, Irena's name spelled out trouble across line three-hundred-twelve.

_I need to talk to Istikbal,_ she noted. For all her frequent visits to her dreams, the goddess had been elusive of late, leaving Irena's calls often unanswered, and only speaking in the puzzling enigmas peculiar to her kind when she managed to get a hold of her – more puzzling than usual, at least.

She turned, heading off in the direction of her first lecture of the day. There were still two full hours until August Vefort would step in through the door of the room where she schooled Irena on the subtle art of mindwalking. But Irena did not want to dally in the dry chill of the winter morning the Academy had woken up to, and the ever-present throbbing in the back of her head ruled revision out of the question.

_At least I won't be late again,_ she thought dryly. _But first, breakfast might be in order._

\*

"Focus, Irena."

"I am."

"No, you are not. You know how I know you are not?"

"Because you are a master Mindwalker, the likes of whose talent hasn't been seen at the Academy for centuries?"

"Because you keep yawning," August Vefort said. "Nice try, though."

Irena sighed, letting her worry settle into her features and take over her bearing. _The best way to tell a lie is not to do it,_ Roidac’s voice echoed in her mind. _The second best way to tell a lie is to do as little of it as you can._ "I have admittedly not been getting a lot of sleep."  
Vefort arched a brow, studying Irena. "Worried about the trials, or is there something else?"

Irena sat for a moment, considering her next words.

It was a curious thing, to sit in that chair with the knowledge that the woman opposite her could reach into her mind and uncover the most carefully hidden of things with the barest effort, turn the cobwebs veiling the darkest corners of it to dust at the flick of a finger. She could puppeteer it totally and ensure Irena could not even _doubt_ such a thing. She could crack her mind open, utterly unravel it until there was nothing left, not a wisp of humanity, of thought or life, let alone a trace of Irena.

_Which one of you can say you are confident enough in your own sanity, your own… selfness… to know for sure?_

"Focus, Irena," Vefort repeated, and Irena felt her cheeks mottle with the embarrassment of having zoned out once again. "What color is the handkerchief?"

Irena closed her eyes, trying to see the cramped room in her mind's eye, the two of them sitting across one another, their chairs the only furniture appointed to the space. The details of the place flowered in her mind, the defined texture of the weft-face weave of the floor, the stark white door spanning to the full height of the room, the tiniest dents along the legs of the wooden chairs. And, the deep vibrations thrumming across her, originating with the August. She felt her mind reach out, her hand gentle, and touch the woman's mind. It was not left completely defenseless, but the present protective barrier was the candlelight borrowed from a blazing fire, a mere speck of her capabilities, held back nearly in full to mirror a more _realistic_ objective. Irena carefully circumvented it, entering the maze of the August's mind.

It was like navigating a vast ocean in a small boat with a single paddle. A vast ocean where the islands were few and far inbetween, and all manner of creatures lurked beneath the surface of the water, drawn to her, and fog hung thick to confuse and disorient her.

"The handkerchief. Find it."

Irena tried to turn toward the source, reaching for the thread of thought in the August's mind that contained the information. She sensed, vaguely, that there _was_ a handkerchief, though that could have been her own mind's phantom voice she was confusing for the August's. The color of the handkerchief, however, stayed firmly out of her reach, stashed away in a locked box somewhere she could not even locate.

"I suppose this might be an appropriate time to tell you I'm colorblind."

"So you've found my clever wit. Put it back. You're looking for a handkerchief," Vefort said; still, Irena could sense the edges of the liminal space she was intruding on softening, illumined by the warm light of faint amusement.

"Will you give me a hint?"  
"Sure. It does not start with an x."

"So not xanthic… That was going to be my answer."

"Irena." At once, Irena felt her consciousness knocked back, the whiplash of expulsion from the woman's mind jolting her awake, the chair cold and hard and solid under her weight. "Stop deflecting. I do appreciate your easy manner, and I am glad you feel comfortable enough to banter with me. And on a good day, I would enjoy retaliation."

"This is not a good day."

August Vefort's lips drew into a taut line. "No."

"I apologize, August Vefort."  
"Apologize to yourself. _You_ are the one who deals with the consequences," said Vefort. She paused, exacting eyes sweeping over Irena's face, and even though Irena knew she was not allowed to pierce into her mind as per the Academy's rules, her mind felt pierced alright. "Is there anything I can… assist you with?"

And for a moment, the words welled within her, ready to burst out of her in a torrent of damning confession. Knowing what Vefort could do, knowing she would not even have to articulate exactly what was happening to her – to even _think_ of what was happening to her, it somehow made Irena wish she could just glimpse into her mind and know the truth of it. _Almost_ wish. Her tongue itched to tell her about the dreams, her mind begged her to utter the words.

The only thing that kept her from doing so was the certainty of expulsion, along with a thorough wipe of everything she had ever known from her memory, were she to cave in. In other words, _utter loss_.

Which was a price Irena was not exceedingly keen on paying.

"Not really," she said at last, and though the nod Vefort gave her lacked conviction, the August let it go.

"Let's call it a day early today," she said, getting to her feet. "I will see you tomorrow, Irena."

Irena only nodded.

She paused by the door, glancing over her shoulder. "And you will tell me what color the handkerchief is."

With that, she left, leaving Irena in the pressing weight of quiet solitude.
