---

Ten minutes past the eighth bell of the morning, on a commonplace Justice Day, that was the phrase being underlined as Irena barreled into the Borealis Hall, heels clicking on the marbled floor. The great oak door swung and crashed into the wall, filling the cavernous hall with an echoing bang.

Irena was late. Again. All too aware of the hundred heads turning toward her, she gathered herself, and she dashed up the tiered seating platforms, trying to shed her discomfort. It clung to her like a second skin, her face burning with the sensation.

_Shit,_ Irena whispered despite herself. She lowered herself into an empty seat, shuffling out of her cloak as August Roidac resumed his lecture.

“Three rules for murder.”

Crisp chalk caressed the blackboard, bright white against the inky backdrop like stardust. Three rules.

_There’s only one rule for murder,_ Irena thought. _Kill._

She leaned back, trying to slow her breathing as she cast a surveying glance about the hall. With gazes trained on the Operations Practical instructor with hawklike focus, only a quarter of the Academy’s second-year students crowded the Borealis Hall now.

A thousand. That was what they had started with. A thousand of the continent’s most promising fledglings, each with a penchant for magic that few in the world possessed, all stolen away by the Academy with the promise of power and influence.

“One.” Roidac turned sharply away from the blackboard, his eyes sweeping the front row. “Will anybody tell me what the first rule for murder is?”

“Avoid.”

Irena glanced at the dark-haired boy in the third row who had spoken, an action mirrored by the better half of the students. Yeosang. His unmoving gaze pierced that of the August’s, his face an arcane tome sealed shut, brimming with pages upon pages of unreadable brilliance. Even among the sea of genius that was the second year’s complement, Yeosang was considered an exception. An invaluable asset, or a vicious threat, depending on the side you were on.

“Correct,” the August said. “Surely you can tell me what that means, Master Kang?”

Yeosang paused for a second, then shrugged. A crack in the veneer. “Try not to do it, unless you must.”

Irena smiled a slight smile.

“False,” Roidac said, not bothering to keep the disappointment out of his tone. “Mistress Vasiljev? Can you tell me why the first rule is ‘avoid?’”

“You can’t commit a perfect murder if you’re already dead," Irena chimed.

“Very good, Mistress Vasiljev.”

As Roidac turned to write, Irena locked her eyes on the boy, trying to focus on the air, seeking out the threads of subdued buzzing with her mind. Too bright. She closed her eyes, suppressing the visual noise to clear space for the other senses, and tried again. And there – she could almost make out a hum of discontent, a ghost twang of gunpowder from the boy's general direction.

_You’re just imagining it,_ Irena told herself. After all, most students in her year had learned to stifle the outflow of their emotions by now, to fortify their minds so that Mindwalkers could not grasp for the stray telltale threads. Mindwalkers like Irena. A better Mindwalker may have found more to grasp. Irena, on the other hand, toed the very precipice of incompetence, a stumble away from plummeting into the abyss.

The chalk finished its smooth stroke on the board, and the August turned to face them once again, his heavy cloak of office swishing behind him as he did. “Master Kang. Rule number two, if you please.”

“Avoid,” Yeosang said, composure clinging to his voice as though it had never left. And perhaps it never had.

Roidac gave a concise nod. “A life, even that of another, is a high price to pay, which is to be avoided unless all other options come at even higher costs.”

_Price. Cost. A life, even that of another._ The stonelike callousness of it all pricked her skin like frost. Such was the way of the Academy, such was the game. And you either played, or you lost. And when you lost, you lost everything.

“Third rule of murder,” Roidac said, looking around. “Master Shun?”

Irena’s eyes found Yeonjun Shun before the boy could answer, his silver hair a beacon difficult to miss. Even with his back turned to her, Irena could feel his commanding air, the brazen presence that took up space around him, a tangible force of confidence. When he spoke, his voice was unwavering. “Kill.”

Irena smiled despite herself. Third rule of murder. _Kill, indeed._

The Borealis Hall was quick to dispense with the second-year class after the twelfth bell, and Irena was already cursing herself for neglecting to pack her bags before the toll, when the August’s voice interrupted her quick gait.

“Irena, a moment.”

As the last of the students filtered out of the hall she turned, stifling a sigh of annoyance, and crossed the gap between herself and the August’s dais.

“Your midterm results,” he said, producing a sealed envelope out of thin air, which he proffered to Irena. “I dealt them out before class began, but since you were late…”

A warning look shadowed Roidac’s face, which she ignored, taking the envelope. Hesitation bloomed within; but better in an empty classroom than outside where other students roamed about, she decided. This was always the worst bit, and that by far. With trembling hands she undid the seal, feeling the sword inch closer to her neck.

And then, at last, she gathered herself, mustering every bit of her strength to stand stone-still, and looked.

“Not bad,” Roidac said.

“Not stellar.” Her tone rang flat enough to her own ears, but she could feel the betrayal on her face.

“You’ll get there. How are the pre-rankings?”

“I’m safe,” she said, managing to keep her face in check this time. She did not need to hide things from Augusts of the Academy, but once you began to let things bleed through the mask, control tended to slip away quickly. And her frustration with the preliminary rankings was a secret better kept to herself. “Thank you, August Roidac.”

Outside the hall, the high-ceilinged corridors were bright yet chilly, illuminated by arched windows and heavy chandeliers fashioned in the likeness of major constellations, twinkling against the dark stone of the plafond. Weaving their way around the stone columns was a scattering of students, heavy cloaks wrapped around muscled shoulders to ward off the cold. Embroidered stars glistened against indigo velvet that rippled with every agile step. Feeling the chill beginning to sink into her skin, Irena drew hers closer around herself as she turned south, circumventing the atrium on her way to the Atheneum. It would be another two days before the bi-weekly pre-rankings listed in the atrium were updated, and Irena’s memory did not need refreshing – the failure was etched in her brain with burning letters, tugging at the fraying edges of her sanity.

_They are just prelims,_ she told herself. _They don’t decide anything. The Trials haven’t begun yet._

The Quasar Trials. Last summer, half of the thousand that had started their education at the Academy had left it forever, leaving behind their new lives. Their magic. Their memories. Even among those fortunate – and more importantly, competent – enough to make it through the First Trials, it was common knowledge what the Academy did to those it discarded. This was ample reason to try and make it through the Quasar Trials, which would prune half of the remaining faction. The half that Irena would kill to be in, if such a path were laid out before her.

The Quasar Trials were, however, not the kind of trials that required or permitted this. The prime purpose of the Academy was to cultivate resourceful individuals, not murderous psychopaths – a fact which liked to slink into the dustiest corners of Irena’s mind and hide.

The early morning air struck Irena like a wall of ice, snatching her away from her thoughts and into alertness. The stretch between the Main Building and the Atheneum was dotted with bare trees and winter grass, the façades of the five buildings surrounding the yard in a crescent imposing and unyielding as they stood sentry over the Academy and the town beneath the precipice.

“Irena!”

Irena turned in the direction of the voice, spotting Yuna jogging toward her, bangs stirring and shifting with the movement. She didn’t try to suppress her smile. “Hey, Yun.”

“What are you up to? They’re serving venison at the diner, do you want to grab some? But we could go for the soup instead?”

“I'm sorry, I don’t have time for lunch today. I’ll see you at dinner?”

“Sounds good,” Yuna said, then seemed to hesitate for a second before adding, “Have you seen Hue, by the way?”

“I haven’t today. Why? Do you need him for something?”

Irena did not miss the slightest speck of urgency in her friend’s headshake. “Not really. I just had a question I wanted to ask…”

“I’ll let him know if I see him,” Irena said, feeling her mind reach out subtly for Yuna’s despite herself. It had become second nature to her, as bad as she was at finding anything. Yet, now, her mind’s hands could sense a slight prickle in Yuna’s aura, like a psychic hedgehog raising its spines against a predator – a predator like Irena. “Hey, I’ve got to run. I’ll see you tonight.”

_What was that about?_ Irena thought as she turned away, setting off toward the Atheneum.

The pavilion of the Atheneum welcomed her like a mother’s embrace, or at least how Irena imagined it to be, warm and familiar. A fire crackled in the hearth, and though the space was vast and made of stone like the rest of the Academy buildings, the cozy air from the fire wrapped itself around her as she strode in.

The pavilion branched off in three directions. The library would be straight ahead, and the right-wing was occupied by bespoke rooms for reading and studying. Irena took the left path, heading off into the wing that hosted the Forge. The rooms upstairs in the left wing functioned as glorified storage cupboards, with doors upon doors that led to materials neatly sorted and inventoried for use downstairs, where the massive Forge dwelled.

Irena did not stop to pick up materials, instead wending her way down the spiraling stairs sheathed in half-shadow. The Forge was a large space filled with tools and machinery, and several actual forges that had given the place its name. The glow of the Forge tinted the carved stone a brighter hue of purple at every step, and the stairs opened up to the subterranean cave buzzing and humming with magical energy, hearths roaring and spitting particolored embers, plumes of smoke in every shade dissolving into the rough, crystal-hewn ceiling. She removed her heavy cloak, sweat already beading on her face. A handful of students were working in the Forge, sleeves folded and shirts sticking to their backs, bare necks glistening with perspiration. A first-year student was frowning at a piece of paper by the alchemical station, curly hair pushed back by his goggles, while a pair of fourth-years worked a massive hearth glowing in turquoise.

No gazes followed as Irena turned in the opposite direction, following the narrow corridor into a cellar-like space with a rotting wooden door and some discarded bones. The door didn’t creak as it opened, though it didn’t close properly anymore after years of use. Beyond it lay more stairs —– a subterranean route leading all the way down to the mountain and into the town beneath. The sultry heat of the Forge didn’t reach far, and very soon Irena was pulling her cloak tight around her once more, hastening her steps to warm herself up.

The tunnels were spaces of humidity and contemplation, with little else to occupy her as she wound her way down in the dim light of the sconces placed every ten steps, many of them decked by webs that cast shadow patterns on the earthen walls. These lights should have gone out decades, perhaps centuries ago — yet there was a lot about the Academy that should be that was not.

The air grew colder and danker the farther she descended. She could never tell when the egress would come into sight until it did. She pushed the heavy iron door open with both hands, warmthless light blessing the narrow earthen tunnel for a few moments before the gate slid shut, snapping back into place with a click. The passageway opened into a tiny storage space at the eastern foot of the precipice, a maze of tarped-over crates in much disuse, a thin carpet of dust broken up by traces of previous passersby. She added hers to it as she crossed the room and left through the front door.

The town of Fyeth Dorei was small enough to be dwarfed by some villages, populated by a measly three hundred and well-nigh completely isolated. It should have been a ditch-water, backward town with barely the resources to get by. It may have been, had the Academy not been built on the cliff right above it. And then there was the matter of the Night Market.

Irena encountered no one as she skirted the town, though chimney smoke wafting from houses betrayed the presence of dwellers. The townscape of Fyeth Dorei was clean and well-maintained, rows upon rows of manicured emerald gardens lush with petunias and hydrangeas. Perennial ivy garlanded some of the façades, well-contained with nary a branch overstepping its bounds. Doors were lacquered, tiled roofs unstained and glimmering a vibrant red even in the cold, thin autumn daylight. Its newly-cobbled streets were empty, its air filled with birdsong and nothing else. Her pace quickened, spurred by uneasiness.

She was almost eager to reach the very edge of town. As the sight of the strange, sheer wall of the Night Market bloomed before her eyes, its purplish hue trembling and refracting light in strange angles, she felt a cool breath of relief flourish in her chest. Through the distorting barrier, a cluster of odd buildings and awned stalls were visible, radiating a sense of general motion though Irena could spot no individual figures in the warp.

As though the pressing quiet of the town was stuffing her ears, she heard no sound coming from inside – only a low buzz that vibrated on her skin, enticing her, pulling her close.

She listened, and she obeyed. She let the market rope her in, her steps sure on stone as she stepped forward, closer and closer until the shimmering wall of purple was right before her. She slipped in, the barrier washing over her like the finest silk cloth, sending chills down her spine.

Then, as sudden as death, her world was flooded with noise and color, an entangled orchestra conducted by chaos itself. It swallowed her whole, sucked in every fiber of her being, boundless, shoreless, sanctus.

The Night Market was open, and she let it consume her.

\*

Marinated in honey and enhanced with plums, the venison steamed, filling the diner with its enticing aromas. As Irena stepped through the lime-green double doors of the diner, her stomach grumbled, reminding her of her hunger.

Her return had been a mere half hour ago, and the dinner bells had already tolled by then. The din of chatter and cutlery enveloped her as her eyes roved to spot Yuna. About a good three hundred were having supper here presently; of the nineteen-hundred-odd students attending the Academy, some five hundred would be eating in the main refectory. Of the rest, a third were scattered among the other four dining halls. A sixth had already eaten, and another sixth would eat later. And the remaining faction would probably shove two sandwiches down their gullets in the middle of a training session and call it a day. The many cafeterias of the Academy were just another attestation to its affluence, which in turn was an attestation to its influence.

The other girl, Irena spotted sitting at an empty table. Aloof and reminiscent of a porcelain doll, her large eyes skimmed the crowd, presumably looking for her. They caught Irena’s about a second later, and she smiled as she waved her friend over.

“Sorry I’m late, Yun,” Irena said as she sat down across from her, draping her heavy cape over the empty chair beside. “Errands took longer than expected.”

“No worries. I only arrived just now,” said Yuna.“How was your afternoon?”

“Well…” Irena shrugged. “Errands, as I’ve said. Still had to sort out my ballgown.”

Yuna’s eyes sparkled at that. “And how did that go?”

“I’m pretty pleased with what I have. Do you have one yet?”

“I bought mine as soon as I found out about the ball.”

Irena nodded absently, her focus straying to the tiny compartment affixed to their table instead. It was a small box of metal with a bell, a dial, and a glass door, a facsimile of which was present at every table. She turned its tiny brass dial to the number ‘2’, and soon enough the bell chimed, two steaming dishes of venison waiting for them in the lit dumbwaiter.

“I wonder…” the younger girl trailed off, then seemed to reconsider what she would say as she picked up her utensils. “Did you have a date to the ball last year?”

Irena felt her expression darken, but didn’t try to stop it. “I did.”

“What happened?”

Irena returned her friend’s wary gaze, hesitating. Yuna was a year younger, which meant she wasn’t playing the Quasar game; and she would never play it against her. While that didn’t mean word didn’t travel through those outside of the Quasar Trials, Irena couldn’t see how this could be used against her now even if it did. It hadn’t exactly been a secret, besides. “I went with Ryujin. It… didn’t end well, suffice to say.”

“Ryujin? Shin Ryujin?”

Irena only nodded, praying to Istikbal for Yuna to drop the subject.

“Do you ever wonder what they do?” Yuna asked, answering her prayers.

“What _they_ do?”

“The others,” Yuna said. “You know. The other students, who have kept their powers in the dark. Do you wonder what they can do?”

Irena shrugged, relief surging inside her as the topic shifted away from Ryujin. Despite herself, she felt her mind reach out and grasp for threads in Yuna’s aura. “Not really.”

The Academy itself did not forbid its students to divulge their talents by any means; it was rather a natural outcome of the Quasar Trials that they did not expose their capabilities to others. After all, the Quasar Trials were but a game — a cruel, exacting one — but a game nonetheless. And games were won by playing one’s hand.

Thus it was that the students of the Academy kept others in the dark about their talents, be it many or few, until the start of the Quasar Trials. Speculation, though, was commonplace.

“I find it best to focus on my own capabilities,” Irena continued_. My own capabilities, my ass._ Her entire shtick was to navigate minds, a task that was as far removed from focusing on herself alone as could be. “And especially for you, Yuna, it doesn’t matter what the others can or can’t do.”

“I know that. But… still. Aren’t you the least bit curious?”

“I suppose. Then again, we'll find out soon enough…”

“You know, ever since I’ve come I’ve been thinking… I mean, I know what is at stake here. But I don’t want all my relationships for the next four years to be…” Yuna made a vague hand gesture, as though she was trying to catch the word that kept eluding her. “Transactional.”

Irena leaned closer to the girl, intensity leaking into her tone. “This is the game, Yun. This is what you signed up for. What we all signed up for.”

“So that’s what this is now? A transaction?”

“Of course not, Yun.”

“And why is that?”

“We’re not…”

“We’re not what? In the same year?” Yuna’s stare was all too cutting against Irena’s. “First years are allowed into the Quasar too, you know.”

Irena’s eyes widened slightly, her hands going still mid-slice. “You can’t possibly be considering that.”

“I’m not,” Yuna said quickly. “But that’s beside the point. Do you really not feel it, Irena? The need to… trust?”

Irena watched her friend for some time before turning back to her venison, a new bearing donned. “Have you found Hue?”

And just like that, the hedgehog spines were raised again, prickling Irena’s psychic hands. “I have. I just had to ask him something about the Operations Practical assignment,” Yuna said much too quickly, then paused. “Are you trying to change the subject?”

“I am succeeding in changing the subject,” Irena said. “Operations deadlines are always on odd Justice Days and the new one doesn’t come out until the following Unity Day. Which means the deadline was already last Justice Day and you haven’t received the new assignment yet.”

“I had a question about the previous one.”

“If you say so.”

They dined in discomfited silence for a spell before Yuna broke it again. “And this year? Are you going with anyone?”

“To the ball? No,” said Irena, cringing inwardly as she replayed her delivery in her mind. After an entire year at the Academy, she still had difficulty controlling her tone. Despite her best efforts, her feelings had a tendency to burst out of her otherwise flat tenor. “What about you?”

“Me neither,” Yuna said. “I had a few people ask but…” She shrugged.

“You don’t need a date to enjoy the ball,” said Irena, a mien of sympathy overtaking her expression. “It’s overwhelming enough as it is.”

“Yeah, I guess…”

“Look. I don’t want to sound like that person, but maybe it’s better that you don’t have a date. The Trials are no joke, Yun.”

“I know that, don’t I? I’m not looking to get married, Irena. I just thought…”

Irena raised her brows.

“I just thought it would be fun.”

“You could ask someone yourself, you know.”

“Oh, I don’t know. I don’t think I could. Besides, it’s not like I have someone in mind.”

“You know…” Irena cracked a smile, trying to meet her friend’s doll-eyed gaze. “The ball will be chock-full of dashing men in their fineries.”

“Do go on.”

“Not to mention you’ll be in regalia of your own, felling princes – nay – emperors to their knees at the sight of you. There will be dancing, and there will be heartbreak. And perhaps at the end of the night, it will be you who leaves a gentleman sighing a wish as you walk away.”

“And he will pen a letter to his mother that very night, won’t he; ‘Mother, at last, I have found her: the breath of my life, the one who will take the throne beside mine and rule with me.’”

“‘Send posthaste the royal ring, and I shall beg for her hand in marriage at once,’” Irena joined in.

Yuna laughed, and Irena sensed the hedgehog spines deflate slightly. "I've never been to a ball before," the younger girl said, poking her dinner. "I guess I want it to be like the ones you grow up hearing about… like in the stories. And I know that's stupid of me, but I still can't help but feel disappointed. Underwhelmed, somehow."

"Then you're in luck. " Darkness oozed from every word, and as the edges of Irena's lips curled upward, it clouded her mind like smoke, the bitterness of irony almost tangible on the tip of her tongue. "I can't tell you if you'll find your fairytale evening at the ball, Yun. But underwhelmed? Never. The ball… The ball is something." she said. Then, she shivered. "It's always something."
