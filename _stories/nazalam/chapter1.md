The first light of the day bathed the Tagnivurl hills in its crimson cast, the susurrating song of the ancient stones that once marked the westernmost edge of the Cauldrist Dominion rising like steam from the ruined fortress. For no less than a thousand paces in all directions stretched naught but the rolling sweep of scorched earth and crushed glass. The crystal dusting the otherwise barren terrain abounded from the deep cracks—telltale of the land’s devastation—bits of colored shards as large as fingers half-buried in heaps of glass powder weathered down by a millennium of storms. They glistened wetly in the glow of the nascent day, the lifeblood of an empire long fallen to ruin.

A sorrel gelding snorted its unease into the chill of dawn, its reins dangling free on its side. It lowered its head, sniffing at the length of gneiss winding around the perimeter of the zenith. The knee-high structure, once an imposing rampart, shimmered iridescently as cyclones of powder danced on its surface. The shades of Rizakel resumed their abstruse games, a millennium after their demise.

With a rustling of pebbles grating against each other, a bald pate appeared out of the large pit at the heart of the ancient fortress. The emerging head, the skin of which was pocked by scars, had two silver horns protruding from the sunken temples: one polished, its tip pointing skyward, the other ending in an abrupt, jagged mess halfway up its length where it had been broken off. Goggles appeared next, followed by a face covered by a mask fashioned out of leather scraps.

“I don’t think it’s here, Boss,” he said, his voice muffled by the covering.

“What’s that? It’s not here, say you, Spiff?” The man seated on a large boulder sat with his arms around his knees, his head resting on them. He straightened to swing a glower at Spiff, spitting. “And you know what happens if I come down there, and the damned thing is there, do you not?”

“Yes, Boss.”

“Then why in Grak’s name would you make me come down there!”

“That would be because I don’t see it, Boss.” Though his mask showed no change, the shift in his voice betrayed a burgeoning grin. “Or you can stay there, if you like. Take my word for it. No offense taken, not by me, leastways. Promise.”

The other man grunted as he pushed himself off the rock, throwing up a plume of powdered glass as he landed on the dead earth. “Every day, a reminder of my folly… isn’t it, Spiff, you damned hinny… Curse the day I ever laid eyes upon you… Curse the coin ajingle in my purse… Why, I could have done with a hut and a wife instead, couldn’t I have! And be all the more at peace for it, of mind and spirit if not for tension of belt… Grak, accursed woman, once I have my paws around that beautiful, dainty neck of yours, I swear…”

Spiff turned away, leaning casually on the side of the pit. A bemused smile alone was evidence that he had heard the muttered soliloquy. His master leaped into the hole, his cloak billowing as he fell.

“Now, where is that damned pot…”

A breeze picked up outside the pit, the patch of deep blue overhead turning diffuse with dust. From nearby came the sound of water gurgling over metal. Spiff’s master froze beside him just as Spiff felt the air glaciate about them.

“Aha!” he hissed, mad eyes swinging toward Spiff. “Ssshhh! What did I say? Quiet!”

*But it was you, Boss… I uttered not a word. And why has my heart found itself adrift in this estuary of fear, all of a sudden? Why does my tongue cower thus? What have you done, Auroch? Or is it the shades of Rizakel at last come to wring their toll for our desecration? I feel it, clinging like dew to my very marrow, aye… We shall not last to see the sun again this dawn.*

Rivulets of sweat snaked down into his goggles even as Spiff felt the cold plunge of his soul in the icy fjords of terror.

A cackle rent the silence. Spiff watched in horror as Auroch wheeled about to face him, his head tipping up toward the darkening sky. No trace of the cold fear Spiff felt within was present in the man’s gaze, however; it quivered hungrily, the poisoned blue of his irises deepening.

A shadow fell upon them. The horned man’s eyes shifted involuntarily toward the mouth of the pit.

“Well! Would you look at that! If it isn’t Auroch the Rancid!”

Spiff shook his head as his eyes readjusted to the dim light of the pit. The figure hanging above them had a face that would have been considered pretty, if it wasn’t so misshapen as though it had been carved in by a strike of a mallet. That, and for the fish scales covering the confused mess of limbs constituting her body.

“Tile?” Auroch exclaimed with a jump. “What are you doing here?”

“Well, friend, I have missed you dearly, as well. That is what you said, isn’t it? My ears aren’t quite so wholesome as they used to be.” She cackled again as Spiff darted a glance at the sides of her—its—head and saw that there was no ear to be found on either one.

“Yes, well, I thought the pleasantries more than accounted for, given our, ah, well-acquainted past,” Auroch said.

“You thought them accounted for, did you? Very well. So be it. Did you fall in a pit, Auroch?”

“Fall? Me?” Auroch scoffed. “The day Gossamer Auroch falls in a pit is the day Geldspur hatches from its geode egg.”

Tile cackled again. “Very well. Then I shan’t offer a hand.”

This time, Spiff found his gaze running over the multitude of her hands, dangling limply from at least a dozen arms, all of them jointed not once but thrice, bent at odd angles.

“Fine. I shall accept your offer, Tile. Help me out.”

Spiff looked away as the creature lowered two of her front arms into the pit and pulled his master out in a motion too strong for its gangly limbs.

“What about you, fishcakes?”

Unease at being regarded by the creature crawled up Spiff’s arms. “No, thank you. I’m—”

“Spiff, you hinny, you dare reject this lovely lady’s offer!” Auroch shouted. “Has your mother taught you naught?”

Spiff gulped. “Now that I think about it, I would appreciate your help, my Lady Tile.”

“Auroch, you genteel dog, you knew ever how to set my heart atitter.” Tile guffawed. “Come, give me a kiss.”

“Uh,” Auroch said.

“Come, come, you have earned it. By your sweet tongue, you have.”

“Thanks,” Auroch hissed as Tile smacked her lips against his cheek, and Spiff was suddenly glad for the mask covering his face.

Another cackle reverberated down the pit. “Well now, what’s your name, Fishcakes?”

“I’m called Spiff.”

“Oh? By whom?”

“By all.”

“Ah, you poor thing.” Tile cocked her earless head. “Perhaps we could make a bargain, once all of this is done.”

“A bargain? For what?”

Tile laughed. “For a new name, of course, what else?”

“Taken up your master’s trade, Tile?” Auroch said flatly.

“Me?! Imagine that! What silliness, Auroch, friend! I have missed your words—what absurd oases they offer in this bitter wasteland of solemnity! Of course not. I could, however, convince my mistress to give you an agreeable discount. Oh yes, very agreeable, indeed.”

“A discount?” Even to his own ears, Spiff’s voice rang dull.

“Of course! You thought my mistress just bestows her gifts for free, did you?!” Tears lined Tile’s eyes as she howled, her host of limbs quivering with joy and amusement. “What treats you both are, cajoled into being from the very ribs of Bird!”

*Whatever disease has driven this… thing… into this madness… I pray it is not contagious.*

“Hoo, hoo. But that was a good laugh, was it not…” Tile said, wiping her eyes with two of her hands. “So, what say you, fishcake Spiff? Shall we try and strike a more than fair bargain with my mistress? As regards the matter of price, I shall be on your side. This, I swear.”

For the first time since the creature’s appearance, something of raw fear filled Auroch’s regard.

*All the more reason not to accept the offer, the first and foremost being the unrest simmering in Spiff’s stomach. He wanted nothing to do with this creature, or her mistress.*

*And yet, has Auroch not told me but a blink ago not to decline Tile’s offers? … I know not the right answer, in truth. If I had erred before, I now am more assured than ever… This is the toll of the Rizakel—of that there is no room for doubt within… This pit which has lain here like a welt on the earth’s skin, as do my scars pock my own, will shelter my pale, glistening bones for a thousand years to come.*

“Your offer is too kind, Lady Tile.”

“It is, is it not?” Tile mused. “Precisely why you would be a fool not to take it!”

“Lest I offend your generous personage, Tile,” Auroch said, his tone tinted by wariness. “But I must ask, er, out of which bountiful wellspring of your kind soul this charity flows forth?”

“Speak plainly, Auroch. I told you my ears are not what they used to be.”

“Well… If you insist… I only meant to inquire as to, er… why?”

“Why? Why what?”

“Your too-magnanimous offer. Why?”

“Oh, see Auroch, I care not for the price paid. An arm? A leg? What’s it to me; I’ve got plenty.” Tile cackled. “No. I do not care. Names, however—that, I care for a great deal.”

“But why?”

“Why? Why?! You’ve done it again, Auroch, you High Priest of Jokes! Ha ha ha. Why? Why does the kitten toy with the mouse? Why does the babe jingle the bell, once and again, then again and again, all night to the chagrin of its caretakers? Why does the turtle bounce the ball around and chase after it? For my own amusement, of course! What!”

Spiff closed his eyes, fear sizzling over the rocks of his heart.

“See, Tile, Spiff here has got not a pijin to his name… Yes, alas, the poor lad depends entirely on his gracious master’s resources, and I haven’t got the means to afford such a luxury, as it happens…”

Tile’s head jerked back, her attention swiveling singularly on Auroch; Spiff exhaled a breath of relief, pleased for the respite, brief as it may be.

“Auroch, you dolt! Did I not tell you I would get you a good deal?”

“You have, but—”

“You do not trust me, then?”

“Tile, old friend, but of course I do! It’s only that I happen to be… well… for lack of a better term, destitute, also.”

“Destitute? So how is it that you feed this one here? He is well-fed, by the looks of it.”

“Cause and effect, my dear. Cause and effect.”

“I see. Hmm…” One of the arms sprouting out of Tile’s back shot forward, and the hand began to stroke her misshapen chin. “A conundrum, indeed. What to do…”

*Shall we get me out of this pit, maybe…*

“Ah!” Tile exclaimed as several of the creature’s hands clicked fingers all at once, including the one that had been stroking her chin. “That’s it! Fortunately for you, my mistress now accepts credit!”

“Credit?” Auroch echoed.

“Yes, that’s what I said. Are your ears also troublesome, Auroch? But yes, credit! You can simply pay her back when you can. Thus and such! Clever idea, no?”

“Ingenious,” Auroch said, swallowing.

“That’s settled then! Now, fishcake Spiff… Shall we get you out of that pit, maybe?”

Imbroglio stood with his back against the room’s tumbledown door, his blank regard trained on the fat man seated before him. The air in the room was thick with the scent of ginger and grease, making his tunic stick to his skin. Daylight stole in through the windows covered with parchment in uneven splotches, painting patterns on the ragged tabletop that covered most of the room.

“And how fares your uncle?” Flitch asked as he poured steaming milk into a ceramic mug from a cracked pitcher. He put a lump of sugar into it, making liquid splash onto the rotting wood. “Excellent, I hope?”

Imbroglio crinkled his nose as the steam filled his nostrils. *You let it sit too long again, Deed. It’s burnt.*

The Syzygy reached for the cup with a plump, unhurried hand. “He passed a fortnight past.”

“That so? I am so very distraught to hear that, your Excellency.”

*Distraught? Only so far as the Syzygy is excellent. The two are one and the same, as truth goes. That is to say, not far at all.*

The Syzygy stretched his leg, one round, slippered foot dragging across the portholed floor as he glanced over a sweaty shoulder at Imbroglio. “Would you mind bringing me some honey, lad?”

“Gladly,” Imbroglio muttered, shuffling aside to open the door. The stale air of the corridor caressed his skin, reminiscent of the freshest mountain breeze, rinsing the bitter scent of burnt milk out of his nostrils.

“Watch out,” Deed said as he shouldered open the kitchen door. She had a tin of something red and viscous in each hand, her small, pretty face freckled with dried juice stains.

“Honey?” he asked, a smile pulling at the edges of his lips.

Deed pointed with her dainty nose toward the shelf. “There.”

“Thanks.” Imbroglio wrenched free the jar glued to the shelf with hardened sugar, taking a sniff. “Is this safe?”

“Mm. Safe for what? Ingestion? Sure. Don’t let it fall on your head, though.”

“Not poison, then.”

The cook glared at him out of the corner of her eye, a divot forming between her brows. *By Joravind’s tail, she is beautiful.* Imbroglio grinned.

“Bummer. The Syzygy asked for it.”

“Roli!” The eyes narrowed at him a moment ago were now wide, shifting from forest green to emerald. *So beautiful.* “Someone might hear!”

He winked, his grin broadening. “Worried about me?”

“There are rumors,” she whispered, placing the two tins down on the narrow counter. “Nasty rumors, at that. About how he acquired his wealth… About what he does with it. Not the worst of which is enough to spook one off of meeting his gaze, let alone suggest… well!”

“You believe in all that, then?”

“Even if I didn’t! Even if you don’t…”

“Yes, I get the message. Be careful, I love you.”

“What?”

“I mean, that’s you. You saying that, I mean… Not me.”

Deed rolled her eyes and turned her back on him to stir whatever concoction was now burning on her stove. The gesture was a shivering spear driving through his yearning heart. “Shit!”

*Gods… But I love you.*

The corridor, which a moment ago had blown thoughts of verdant glades and blooming valleys into Imbroglio’s mind now reeked of mold and pathos. He frowned at the sticky residue the jar left on his hand. *Maybe he could excuse himself to clean his hands…*

He paused at the threshold as bits of muffled conversation drifted out, against the Syzygy’s nasal whine.

“…suggest to Grymdark such a possibility?” Flitch’s oily drawl had risen, indicating a question.

*Grymdark? Where have I heard that name before…*

“Out of the question.”

“But, your Exce—”

“Shush, Flitch.”

A silence exploded, followed by a creaking of hinges. Imbroglio had not yet touched the door, but it swung open before him, revealing the two men situated as he had left them. Veins of surprise popped on Flitch’s flustered visage as he looked up at him. When the Syzygy swung round, however, there was scant else but fury etched into the folds of his round face.

Imbroglio thrust with a shivering hand the jar of honey toward the man, all thoughts of excusing himself long evaporated from his mind. What remained in its stead was naught but a slurry of panic and precipitance to match the one in his breeches.

“Ah.” The Syzygy’s fat face softened, his eyes receding into their pits of flesh. “Give it here, boy.”

Imbroglio found his legs carrying him forward even as he marveled at his ability to move, for he felt as if fetters had been clamped upon his very spirit.

*And who is to say that they haven’t… Blast me, Deed, but you warned me, like an angel of Gnaw…*

“Say, boy, how would you like a cup?” The Syzygy picked up the dirty glass jar and scraped a spoonful of congealed honey into his milk. His lips bulged around his finger as he sucked on the remains, smacking wetly. “Flitch, pour another cup, would you?”

“At once, your Excellency.” Flitch’s aura of roasted spice and overripe fruit roiled about Imbroglio as he brushed past. The door shut behind him, the rotten wood rattling in its frame. The fat merchant said nothing, inspecting the rings on his hand with a flat gaze. At the center of each one was a gem as big as a marble, every one a different color. His flesh bulged at the rims, giving Imbroglio the impression that the rings had been slipped on in some distant, miraculous past when the man had been less well-padded. Imbroglio sat with his hands flat against the tabletop to keep them from trembling as they waited.

The moments crawled on until, at last, the door opened once more; and behind it appeared Flitch’s scowl. He placed a dirty, cracked mug in front of Imbroglio. The Syzygy watched him levelly as he poured milk into it.

The burnt milk crackled on his tongue like a long-awaited kiss from Deed.

“Let us get back to our discourse, Flitch. But first, answer me this one question. What do you know of my liege, Grymdark? And, by all means, divulge all there is crammed in a corner of your tiny mind.”

*His… liege? Why, then, does the name stir senses of antiquity within me?*

“Certainly not all that is worth knowing; indeed, the faculties of this feeble mind are scarce, just as you suggested. I am but a humble—”

The Syzygy waved a ringed hand dismissively. “I tire of your drivel, old man. I have diversions more productive and fulfilling than attending to the refuse that leaves your mouth so readily. For instance, watching grass grow in ditchwater.”

Flitch’s mouth snapped shut, and he nodded. “As you say, your Excellency. What do I know of Grymdark, but that he is the Lord of the Veil? That he has birthed from his own thigh the Moondaughter, Mother of Solace. That he has fashioned the scythe, upon which the First of the Rizakel was conceived? That his each Stirring marks the death of an age and the rise of another? That we are all but rust and rot on the spokes of his wheel?”

Imbroglio found himself staring at the old man. What had started as an obliging address had long since descended into a crazed chant, shadows conquering the folds of his face ever-deepening, before his very eyes.

Darkness began to creep up Flitch’s legs. “What do I know of Grymdark, Draveth Onaril?”

The Syzygy’s jaw slackened, and Imbroglio sensed the air of the cramped room stir around him. Flitch’s voice expanded, reaching out to them in tendrils of screeching like whetstone grinding against metal, suffusing every crack and cranny.

“For all there is to know about Grymdark, naught will avail you.”

“Lord of the Veil… Great One…” The Syzygy’s eyes shone wetly in their pits. “Mercy… I beg for your mercy!”

“Mercy, Draveth?” Tremors rent through the rotten foundation of the shack as the creature of shadow bellowed in laughter. “Mercy it is, then! Mercy upon your soul!”

Imbroglio clapped his hands over his ears as the silk-shrouded form of the Syzygy ascended, its radiance searing white, like iron drawn fresh from the forge. It vanished a heartbeat later, showering Imbroglio with sparks of gold, the scorched remnants of his silk robes fluttering down to land atop the tabletop like unfastened tent flaps yanked about in the wind.

The shadows that had swallowed Flitch undulated as the voice spake anew. “Granted. Thus.”

And then it was gone.
