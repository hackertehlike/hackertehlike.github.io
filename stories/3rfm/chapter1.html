            Three rules for murder. Ten minutes past the eighth bell of the morning, on a commonplace Justice Day, that was the phrase being underlined as Irena barreled into the Borealis Hall, heels clicking on the marbled floor. The great oak door swung and crashed into the wall, filling the cavernous hall with an echoing bang. Irena was late. Again. All too aware of the hundred heads turning toward her, she gathered herself, and she dashed up the tiered seating platforms, trying to shed her discomfort. It clung to her like a second skin, her face burning with the sensation.

            Shit, Irena whispered despite herself. She lowered herself into an empty seat, shuffling out of her cloak as August Roidac resumed his lecture. "Three rules for murder."

            She leaned back, trying to slow her breathing as she cast a surveying glance about the hall. With gazes trained on the Operations Practical instructor with hawklike focus, only a quarter of the Academy’s second-year students crowded the Borealis Hall now. A thousand. That was what they had started with.

            "One." Roidac turned sharply away from the blackboard, his eyes sweeping the front row. "Will anybody tell me what the first rule for murder is?" "Avoid." Irena glanced at the dark-haired boy in the third row who had spoken, an action mirrored by the better half of the students. Yeosang. His unmoving gaze pierced that of the August’s, his face an arcane tome sealed shut, brimming with pages upon pages of unreadable brilliance. Even among the sea of genius that was the second year’s complement, Yeosang was considered an exception. An invaluable asset, or a vicious threat, depending on the side you were on.
