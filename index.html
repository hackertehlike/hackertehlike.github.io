                * welcome to my website * please stand by * this website is under construction * 
                i'm doing my best okay *
                no seriously *
                this isn't as easy as it looks *
                so i made this website so you can see what i've been up to *
                and obviously i've been up to a lot of things *
                why won't these boxes go where i want them to go *
                so anyway *
                as i've said i've been up to a lot of things *
                you can click on the icons to see what i've been up to *
                some of it anyway *
                for example, i've been learning how to make websites *
                but you don't need to click on an icon to see that because you're already on a website i've made *
                but also i've been up to some other things *
                mostly i've been up to some other things *
                like for example, not doing the school work i'm supposed to be doing *
                css goes brrr *
                actually the menu button doesn't work but that's because i don't know what to put there yet *
                why did i make it clickable then? *
                it's a prank, i suppose *
                did you know that no one knows what css stands for *
                css stands for <s>cool stuff</s> *
                css stands for cascading style sheets *
                thank you for being here *
                i hope you enjoy your stay *
